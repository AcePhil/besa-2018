35
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,180
Good morning.
Where's the fire, Dukic?

36
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,080
Yesterday, Mehmet Agani was killed
in Rovin.

37
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,880
The owner of the "Adriatic Nord" company.

38
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,280
One water, please.

39
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,680
What does that have to do with us?
Probably nothing.

40
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,280
Except that Agani was an old friend
and associate of Dardan's son-in-law,

41
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,580
Agim Sokoli.
We're leaving!

42
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,780
Mirko, I want you to check
a murder in Croatia.

43
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,280
Mehmet Agani, right away!

44
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,980
Can I ask where he was?
No.

45
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,280
And what would you think if I showed up
with a gunshot wound?

46
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,380
I don't believe it,
and better not to know.

47
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,580
Oh, damn it!

48
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,780
What is this?
Antibiotics and painkillers.

49
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,180
I'm afraid the results
will disappoint you.

50
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,480
We're used to it.

51
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,180
None of the DNA samples
you brought us,

52
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,080
match those
from the crime scenes, which means,

53
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,680
none of these men
were there.

54
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,780
Of course, they may have worn rubber
gloves and been very careful.

55
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,980
I doubt it.
They are from the "old school."

56
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,580
And yet there's something
that may or may not mean anything.

57
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,780
And what is it?

58
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,480
We found the same DNA
on the genitals of the dealer,

59
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,580
on the clothes of the journalist, and in
the room where the DJ was killed.

60
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,380
That's it.
Thank you, sir.

61
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,080
Alright, damn it.

62
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,880
We're missing something.
Obviously.

63
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,080
What do we do now?

64
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,080
What if the same guy killed
Agani in Rovin?

65
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,780
And the three previous victims are connected
to the death of Besiana Berisha.

66
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,680
I really don't know what Agani
has to do with it.

67
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,280
I don't know either, probably nothing.
He's probably involved in something else.

68
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,480
Let's get going.

69
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,980
What's up?
I'm listening.

70
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,780
What do you want to hear?
The whole story.

71
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,680
Do I have to?

72
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
Come on, sit.

73
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,780
Greetings from the sea.
Received a postcard.

74
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,380
Let the driver rest one day,
then send him south.

75
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Understood.

76
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,680
Seems like you fancy the driver, huh?
He'll become a man.

77
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,380
Let's go.
Goodbye. Have a nice day.

78
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,380
I can't get up.

79
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,580
You're vomiting a lot.

80
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,180
Thinking about it,
it might be better to die

81
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,780
than be in your place.

82
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,180
Boss, you were looking for me.
Yes.

83
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,580
Tell Enver to take the documents
and head to Kosovo with the bus.

84
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,780
Hashim?
Tell him.

85
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,880
Drive Teuta to the airport in Tivat.

86
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,780
Consider it done!

87
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,180
Afrim, get the car ready!

88
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,680
I want to go to the cemetery.
Understood!

89
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,480
Did you say goodbye to your mother?

90
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,680
Get up!

91
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,380
Be good and listen to your father!
Right? Mom will come soon.

92
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,280
Take care of your brother!

93
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,580
See you on Monday.

94
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,780
Where are you going, dad?

95
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,580
To the cemetery.
Can I come too?

96
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Come.

97
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,080
Stop!

98
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Be careful!

99
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,980
Let's go, we're leaving.

100
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,580
Go, go!

101
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,380
Watch your head!

102
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,480
Take him to the operating room!
Keep his head elevated!

103
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,080
Hold on!
His life is not in danger.

104
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,580
Let's take care of his wounds
quickly!

105
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,980
Let's go! Two at the front entrance,
two at the back!

106
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,480
No one goes in or out
until the special forces arrive!

107
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,780
Boss!

108
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,680
Damn it!

109
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,580
Is he alive?

110
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,480
They say he's alive.

111
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,850
They also say that the shooters
were uniformed, from your side.

112
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,840
If it's you, the city will burn,
you know that?

113
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Easy, anyone can
put on a uniform these days.

114
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,180
No one in the police is crazy enough
to shoot Dardan Berisha.

115
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,080
You have all sorts among you.
We'll block the entrances.

116
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,680
No one steps in!
No one steps out!

117
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,280
You can't block the hospital.
It's full of patients, it needs to operate.

118
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,980
Go to the church and light a candle.

119
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,680
If he dies... you'll regret being alive!

120
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,780
One of ours shot him. But he's former,
dismissed for corruption.

121
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,180
Be quick!
They shot Dardan.

122
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,280
The attackers were wearing
police uniforms.

123
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,980
They're fighting for his life.

124
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,680
They've blocked the entire hospital.

125
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,880
Aren't you going to say anything?

126
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,980
Special forces to surround the building!

127
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,960
And don't take any action
until I arrive!

128
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,560
Understood, give me a second.

129
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,260
Alright, your flight to Montenegro
is in three hours,

130
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,660
you already have your ticket!

131
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,960
<i>From Avdi: Agani is competition in the bid
for Brezovica. Call me.</i>

132
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,560
Do you know what Mehmeth Agani did
before they killed him?

133
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,860
He submitted documents for a bid,
for that ski resort in the south.

134
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,760
Call our colleague in Croatia.
You're going to Rovin.

135
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,260
I'll call Mirko.

136
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
Where is my son?

137
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,060
Ma'am, please get out!
- Calm down, dear.

138
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,260
Will he be okay?
- Will you leave or should I?

139
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,360
Dear... I'm here.
Don't be afraid.

140
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,960
Calm down. I'll wait for you outside.

141
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,560
Come on, be strong.

142
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,260
How is Dardan?

143
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,260
He's in the operating room.
Luckily, he was wearing a bulletproof vest.

144
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,660
Who was it?
- I don't know.

145
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,260
Who shot at my child?
- I don't know.

146
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Who was it?
- I don't know.

147
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,760
Who was it? Who was it?

148
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,260
We'll find him even if
he's hiding in a mouse hole.

149
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,260
Find him!
- You come with me. We have work to do.

150
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,460
How many people do we have?
- Fifteen.

151
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,160
Block everything, stairs,
elevators, every entrance.

152
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,960
And not a fly should pass through the hospital
without my permission!

153
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,860
What if he doesn't survive?
- Excuse me?

154
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,660
Enver...

155
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,760
Look at them. See how they gather like wolves.

156
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,860
What do we do if they come in?

157
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,760
We'll keep them out, Enver.
We won't let them in.

158
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,160
Hashim, I respect Dardan a lot,
but I don't want him to die in vain.

159
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,960
Enver, don't forget
we've given our word, Besa,

160
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,560
to stay with him to the end.

161
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,060
Did you forget?

162
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,760
I'll damn them all...

163
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,260
Mrs. Berisha, the bullet
that went through him,

164
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,160
entered through the right cheek
and exited through the left.

165
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,660
That's the good news.

166
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,960
So, is there bad news too?
- There is.

167
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,560
The bullet tore off the entire
front of his tongue.

168
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,560
We stitched the piece we found in his mouth,
but...

169
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,060
The tongue isn't whole.

170
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,760
Will he be able to speak?

171
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,760
The bullet severed Driton's tongue.

172
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,160
Horrible...

173
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,460
And Dardan?

174
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,060
I don't know yet; he's still in the operating room.

175
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,780
He'll pull through, I'm sure!

176
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,080
I hope so, Agime.
I hope he pulls through.

177
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,380
But I won't pull through...
I'm completely destroyed.

178
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,780
Everything will be okay.

179
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,380
Okay? Can you bring back
Driton's tongue?

180
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,780
Hello.
- Where have you been?

181
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,880
Oh, wait a minute. Are you okay?
- I'm not, let's dig in!

182
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,280
I can't. I'm tired.
- Come on! Shall I take over?

183
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,080
Come on.
- You're hitting softly.

184
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,980
Come on, hit a bit harder.
- Harder, huh?

185
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
Go ahead.

186
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,880
Let me see!

187
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,980
Maybe you're not that tired.
- Sorry.

188
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,080
It's okay.

189
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Dad?
Is he back?

190
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,780
Are you hungry?
- No, sweetheart.

191
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,480
You need to eat.
And I want to talk to you.

192
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,380
What's up?
- How was it in Banja Luka?

193
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,480
Work is work.

194
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,980
I'm exhausted from the journey.

195
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,980
Will you tell me what's going on?
- Why?

196
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,580
What should be happening?

197
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,880
Do you know that your mom thinks
you have a mistress?

198
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,180
I know. I know about it.
- You know?

199
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,720
Do you think we don't see
you falling apart?

200
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,620
Dad, look at yourself.
- Where were you?

201
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,220
Dad, you need to pull yourself together.

202
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,620
And let me tell you one more thing...

203
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,620
Why are you yelling?

204
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,920
Dad is back.

205
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,420
What's happening now?

206
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,620
Can you hear me?

207
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,320
I hurt my hand
while changing the tire.

208
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,120
Really?
- Really.

209
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,420
Why do you constantly lie to me? Do you think
I'm stupid? Where were you?

210
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,620
It's not what you think.
- What do I think?

211
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,720
That there's another woman? If so,
that's the least of the problems.

212
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,420
Haven't we agreed not to lie to each other?
- We have.

213
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,220
Then why are you lying to me?

214
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,620
Why didn't you take our car?
- I don't know.

215
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:31,220
The drive shaft broke, and I had to call
for roadside assistance.

216
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,720
They took the car, but they didn't have
the parts to fix it.

217
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,720
The damage isn't that light,
they said...

218
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,320
I can't... I can't...

219
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,920
Where are you going?
- I don't know.

220
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,920
What's the situation?
- We're waiting.

221
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,720
And the job?
- We continue as usual.

222
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,820
Someone will call you.
- Can I ask one more question?

223
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,020
Briefly.
- What happens if it doesn't get fixed?

224
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,420
I'll pretend I didn't hear you.

225
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,120
Okay, I didn't ask.

226
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,220
Your mommy's nasty, shrimp!

227
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,220
I'm listening.
- Darling...

228
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,320
What do you want?
- I miss you.

229
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,920
Something seems fishy, huh?

230
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,720
You have a new task.

231
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,120
I'm waiting for you under the bridge in half an hour.

232
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,820
<i>Early this morning in Ulcinj,
an attempt was made on the life of</i>

233
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,120
<i>the boss of one of the strongest
criminal clans in the region,</i>

234
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,420
<i>Dardan Berisha.
According to unconfirmed information,</i>

235
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,520
<i>Berisha was shot
with automatic weapons,</i>

236
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,220
<i>three people dressed in uniforms
of the Montenegrin Police.</i>

237
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,420
<i>Berisha was taken to the hospital in Ulcinj.</i>

238
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,020
<i>Our sources report
that Dardan Berisha,</i>

239
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,820
<i>has died after receiving
six gunshot wounds.</i>

240
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,620
<i>but we still don't have
confirmation.</i>

241
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,420
Yes!

242
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,120
Thanks! Thank you!

243
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,320
Where are you, Mima?

244
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,720
I heard that you're unemployed now?

245
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,420
But you're really dumber
than I thought!

246
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,020
You believe the media, huh?

247
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,220
You'll have to do some work for Mima too.

248
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,420
Don't lose your training.

249
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,520
The anger was only for Dardan.
Don't make me get out of the car.

250
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,620
Don't be cute; you'll get beaten up.

251
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,320
Did someone's balls grow?
From now on, forget I exist.

252
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,920
Is someone's ego inflated?
Don't force me to come down from the car.

253
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,120
Pedal, you wretch.

254
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,220
Where to?

255
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,720
To see if my nephew is alive.

256
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,620
Stay here, can't go any further!

257
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,420
Are you ready to die for this?
I am ready! Back off!

258
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
Oh, Skender!

259
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,920
Good day, I wish.
Since you said it, Spasoje.

260
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,920
Why did you block here?

261
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,620
You blocked the floor
of the hospital, and we're here.

262
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,120
We're guarding Dardan, and you?

263
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,220
You may
have shot at him.

264
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,520
Maybe.

265
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,820
But there's someone to check that.
Those in costumes.

266
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,920
We with the bulletproof vests only shoot.

267
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,620
Right?
Spasoje...

268
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,720
If it were your son, would something
stop you from seeing him?

269
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,920
Driton is alive.

270
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,420
Dardan is still in the operating room.

271
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,920
Now we can't do anything.
We're waiting.

272
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,320
Is everything blocked?
Yes.

273
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,820
Split the people into two teams.
You stay here during the day, and you at night.

274
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,620
Now go.
Understood.

275
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,620
You guard the door...
door... door... door.

276
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,320
Mrs. Berisha...

277
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,220
He'll live. We removed
several bullets from him. Quite a few bullets.

278
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,720
One more remains. For now,
we won't touch it

279
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,620
because it's between the aorta
and the vertebral column.

280
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,920
We'll wait for him to stabilize,
and that will happen.

281
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,220
The outlook is good.
Thank you, doctor.

282
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,700
Have a nice day.

283
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,000
What's the situation?

284
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,400
The hospital is cordoned off. They're not letting
anyone in. We have information

285
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,900
about at least 15 armed
individuals inside.

286
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,400
I will go in.

287
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,900
I want to speak with Skender.

288
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,610
Hello, Uncle Skender!
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

289
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,010
Very long.

290
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,910
We last saw each other
at our house in Pristina,

291
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:23,710
37 years ago.
I remember it as if it were today.

292
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,300
It was Bayram when you killed my father.

293
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,700
And now, what do you want?

294
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,300
I want you to withdraw your people.

295
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,100
The police should guard
Dardan and Driton.

296
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,200
And how do I know
you didn't order the attack?

297
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,200
There's no way to know...

298
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,700
But you have to trust me.

299
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,400
Once he comes to his senses, Dardan has to
give testimony, and so does Driton.

300
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,080
I guarantee
nothing will happen to them.

301
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,760
I don't trust you or the police.

302
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,930
And I didn't trust your father either,

303
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,490
even though he was better,
much better than all of you.

304
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,940
Is that why you killed him?

305
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,400
I killed him because we were adversaries.

306
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,160
But I respected him.
I respected him a lot.

307
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,030
You know I'll never
forgive you, right?

308
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,230
Never!

309
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,530
You have 24 hours to decide
what you're going to do...

310
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,430
After that, I'm coming with my people.

311
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,100
