How are you?

Great?
How are your relatives?

38

Petrit knows I was in Rovin.

43

And what did you tell him?

44
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,380
If I had told him anything,
I wouldn't be here.

45
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,280
Or maybe you did tell him.

46
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,980
And both you and Petrit
play some game.

47
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,780
Maybe it's like that.

48

No.

81
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,880

Yon.

99
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,080
Like the accent, so is the name.

100
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,280
Do you speak Albanian?
A little.

101
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,080

Well, let's talk,
for a hypothetical situation.

119
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Come on.
Let's imagine a situation,

120
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,480
where someone would give you
a huge sum of money,

121
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,980
to continue your work,
just by changing the company.

122
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,180
What would your response be?

123
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,980
Well, since it's only hypothetical,
it's hard to say.

124
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,880
But if the amount is seven digits,
in euros?

125
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,780
If it wasn't hypothetical,
I'd kick your damn ass! Got it?

126
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,180
Calm down. We didn't mean to offend you.

127
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,880
Please, check
your bank account.

128
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,580
Where did this money
come from in my account?

129
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,780
From the boss.
Who's the boss?

130
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,480
The boss is Agim Sokoli.

131
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,880
Are you aware
that you're playing with death?

132
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,880
Control over the entire
territory of Serbia.

133
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,980
A percentage of the profit. And your hands
will be untied.

134
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,280
Think about it until tonight.
If not, nothing for anyone.

135

Hypothetically, we were talking
about seven figures.

136
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,680
And in the account, I see only six.

137
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,080
The seventh digit depends
on your answer.

138

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,880
Damn it!

162
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,280
I messed everything up.

163
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,480
And you?

164
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,180
Do you have children?
A daughter.

165
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,780
Female children. Only female children.

166
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,080
Do you want beer?
No, I can't, really.

167
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Thank you, but I have to go.
Let's share one?

168
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,480
We can share one.

169
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,880
Here, you forgot your phone
in the room.

170
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,980
Agim.
Hello, little sister.

171
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
How are you?

172
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,080
How is Driton?
He realized he won't be able to speak.

173
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I spread a rumor. I'm looking for the villains.

174
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Find them!

175
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,780
God help them when I catch them!

176
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,280
How is Dardan?
Physically, he's okay, but...

177
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,080
Mentally, it's a wreck.

178
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,380
He doubts everyone... even me.

179
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
I have no words.

180
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,180
Agi, I can't take it anymore.

181
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,980
Can I come to you?
Of course. Will he let you?

182
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,780
I think so.

183
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,280
Anyway, he neither looks at me
nor talks to me.

184
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,880
What about Bashkim?
I want to come alone,

185
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,080
to get away from everyone.
When can you send a plane?

186
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,580
Whenever you say.
Can it be tomorrow?

187
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,080
I'll tell them now.
Take care, I kiss you.

188
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,480
Take care.

189
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,280
You shouldn't go.

190
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,780
I've told you a hundred times.

191
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,680
This is not your job.

192
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,380
It became my job when he
maimed my son.

193
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,980
Dardane.

194
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,680
You know I've never wanted
anything from you.

195
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,880
That's right. You haven't.

196
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,280
Now I do.

197
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,480
I'll go even without your permission.
I know.

198
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,280
Don't doubt it.

199
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,580
Then why are we discussing it?

200
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,580
Because I respect you.

201
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,880
And...

202
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,780
The children?
Driton is no longer a child.

203
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,680
Bashkim knows he's Berisha.

204
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,680
He'll get used to it.

205
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,780
And you?

206
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,580
Who are you?

207
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,780
Your wife.

208
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
Hey!

209
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,380
Una?

210
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,180
Una?

211
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,680
Come look at me, darling!

212
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,880
Look at me, baby.
Look at me, hey!

213
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,780
Una?

214
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,080
Una, please look at me!

215
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,080
Damn it.
Okay, okay, okay.

216
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,980
Let's do this,
I'll sit with you. Is it okay?

217
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,480
Is it okay?

218
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,780
Come.

219
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,580
Give me a cigarette.

220
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,380
Please!

221
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,280
Come on, I'll buy you ice cream
if you give me a cigarette.

222
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,480
We're not fighting now, okay?

223
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Please!

224
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,980
Please!

225
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,180
Give it to me.

226
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,780
Give it to me.

227
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Do you want to play?
Football?

228
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,380
Football...
Shall we play?

229
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
Come on.

230
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,580
Come on.

231
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Hello?
I'm coming now...

232
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,280
You walk too confidently.

233
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,280
You liked everything I did for you.

234
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,480
Have you decided?
I think so.

235
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,080
Your brother convinced me.

236
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,880
Yes, he can be very persuasive.

237
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,880
So, until tomorrow?

238
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,580
You won me over.

239
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,480
Hello?
Hey, it's me. Can you hear me?

240
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,280
Don't worry about anything,
I'll call you when I can...

241
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,280
Go there!
Get lost!

242
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,680
<b>Montenegro Podgorica</b>

243
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,780
<b>Ulcinj</b>

244
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,460
Call your wife.
The number is Kosovar. She's there.

245
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,460
Call Petrit.
I called him. No answer.

246
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
<b>Belgrade Beginning</b>

247
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,160
<b>Kosovo</b>

248
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,160
<b>Kosovo</b>

249
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,460
Ana Klimendi.
Sit down.

250
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,760
It's clean.

251
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,760
Let's talk about something
that concerns us.

252
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,160
Dardan Berisha.
You can't catch him,

253
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,060
but it's a problem for our business.

254
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,060
And who are you?
Sokoli's relatives.

255
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,760
Agi Sokoli's?

256
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,260
Mrs. Klimendi, I'm an inspector...
I know.

257
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,060
Chenge. And I am a miss, and I have a business proposal for you.

258
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,660
What should it be?
Nothing. Thank you.

259
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,360
I have information about the person
you're looking for regarding the murders.

260
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,060
And he will lead you to Dardan.
And in return?

261
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,960
Just be flexible
when transporting our goods.

262
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,960
This would be the perfect
moment to leave.

263
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,560
Before I arrest you.

264
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,460
Your inefficiency
has become legendary.

265
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,460
Don't be offended.

266
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,560
Can I ask you another question?
Well, try.

267
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,960
What will you be doing tonight?

268
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,160
Goodbye, Miss Klimenti.

269
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,760
Where was the call made from?

270
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,660
I don't know, they spoke
very quickly,

271
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,360
but we know for sure
that it's somewhere in Kosovo.

272
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,960
Tell Avdi to check with
the border police.

273
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,460
One of the Germans was there.
And?

274
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,560
It's about Hans Zimmer,
53 years old, a lawyer.

275
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,260
Respected member of the
German Democratic Party.

276
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,960
Works as the director of the privatization agency,
appointed by the European Parliament

277
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,660
and Elsa Fischer,
who is the leader of the Austrian Young Party.

278
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,860
One of them arranged with Dardan
for an auction, for Mehmet Agani.

279
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,560
One of them, both of them are blaming Dardan
for the auction, for Mehmet Agani.

280
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,760
And boom - murder in Rovin!
Write to Interpol colleagues

281
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
in Germany and Austria to check them.

282
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,760
Where in Kosovo?

283
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,060
With Dardan?
It doesn't make sense to be with Dardan.

284
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,760
It also doesn't make sense to kill
everyone involved in the death of his daughter.

285
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,660
Let's put that aside. We'll focus
on Uros's victims.

286
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,860
The dealer who sold her ecstasy.

287
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,560
The Englishman who most likely
made Besiana take it.

288
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,860
The journalist
who discredited Dardan.

289
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,560
And the man who participates
in the auction instead of Agim.

290
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,160
Who's next?
According to this logic, Agim.

291
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,960
Only if Perich is Superman.

292
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,360
So these are the Twins.

293
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,460
Jole and Mare Cholovich.
You owe me another 200!

294
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,860
Jole and Mare Cholovich.

295
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,360
Well, Mare has a tattoo on his hand.
Yes, that scorpion.

296
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,860
Now they're at "Bonbons"
with some girls.

297
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,060
It's all for you, bro!

298
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,460
Come on, we'll talk. Bye.

299
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,160
I'm not uptight.
Is that so?

300
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,560
I'm serious.
I'll see you.

301
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,260
Yes, you will see.

302
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,960
Come in.

303
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,260
Come on, get out!
Get out!

304
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,560
Drive! Drive, drive!
Fast, fast!

305
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,960
Don't do that, man!
Don't do that!

306
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,760
Come on, let's talk.
Let's understand each other.

307
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,460
Luka!

308
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,860
Luka!

309
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,060
We're not going to fight now
over some chick!

310
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,660
Don't! Don't!

311
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,160
Don't, man! Don't!

312
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,860
Don't, Luka!

313
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,360
Damn it!

314
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,160
Is it Mima?

315
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,060
Work, bro…

316
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,360
I'll fuck your mother!
Run, fuck your mother!

317
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,060
Go away, your mother!

318
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,460
Your pussy mother!
I'll fuck your mother!

319
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,260
Fuck your mother!

320
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,960
Is it Mima?
Mima is the whore I fucked!

321
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,360
See how he lapped my cock! Tongue,
I didn't take a picture for you, your mother!

322
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,060
Let's go!

323
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,680
Is it Mima?

324
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,280
It's Mima.

325
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,380
Sleep, sleep, my son,

326
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,680
who washes your diapers?

327
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,880
Your mother washes you,

328
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:05,080
beautiful, the biggest...

329
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
I'm sorry…

330
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,620
…that I wasn't a better wife to you.

331
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,120
Forgive me for not giving you
a normal life.

332
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,020
I failed.

333
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,200
