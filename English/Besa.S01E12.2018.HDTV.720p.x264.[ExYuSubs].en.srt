Welcome, little sister!

33
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,180
Well caught.
Where is Ilir?

34
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,380
He's around here somewhere.
Let's have coffee.

35
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,280
These are his fake passports.

36
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,380
And this is the Bosnian phone.

37
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,780
He had it with him
when he killed Agani in Rovinj.

38
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,380
He called his wife
from this phone.

39
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,980
And this is a disk,
with pictures of your man.

40
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,480
It will be useful to you.

41
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,780
And what's this?
No, no, no.

42
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,180
This one is mine.
My communication with him.

43
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,480
Don't screw me over, okay?
Who would screw such a handsome man?

44
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,780
Dardan worries me.

45
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,280
It's like he's lost his way.
And you told me, and people talk.

46
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,680
Let them talk.
We lost our daughter.

47
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,080
People always talk.
That's right.

48
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,280
But it's not good for our business
to talk too much.

49
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,880
Sometimes words
are more dangerous than bullets.

50
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,080
And did you find out who shot him?

51
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,580
And you? You said you would do everything
to find the culprits.

52
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,880
Auntie, welcome!

53
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,980
Ilir's wife is pregnant.

54
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,180
Congratulations!

55
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,180
Hopefully, when he grows up,
he'll be as handsome as Driton.

56
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,680
Really?

57
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,080
How is this possible?

58
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,580
Evidence from the crime scenes?

59
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,980
Everything is destroyed?
Everything?

60
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,480
Thank you.

61
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,380
Thank you.

64

You leave in two hours.

65
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,780
Vetum Leka, from Lyon.
Ordinary, family man.

66
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
No criminal record.

67
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,980
And he stormed the laboratory
with a clear conscience, right?

68
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,880
The French police say
he explained his actions as

69
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,880
temporary insanity, but the point is
that his wife is from Kosovo,

70
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,280
from the Berisha clan.

71
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,580
What are we going to do now?
Nothing.

72
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,780
Uros Peric is a free man.

73
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,780
All evidence has been destroyed,
even the crime scene clues.

74
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,980
The warrant has been withdrawn.
They are ahead of us again.

75
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,780
But maybe we can
get ahead of them?

76
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,980
Do you think Agim is next?
Why don't we try to stop him?

77
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,280
I'm not sure.
As much as he hates Agim,

78
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,980
Dardan's wife is crucial to him.

79
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,280
He wouldn't kill his son-in-law,
because it would risk

80
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,480
his clan falling apart completely.

81
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,480
Okay, then who?
Who's next?

82
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,480
There are several candidates.
There are even some in the privatization fund.

83
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,880
Plus Cimer.
Plus Agim's son, Ilir.

84
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,880
There are quite a few.
Alright.

85
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,880
I'll call Avdi, arrange
discreet security for Cimer in Pristina,

86
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,480
and you... call Vienna.

87

Put a tail on Elsa.
Hey!

88
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,880
Inspector Koçi...
I feel like you do.

89
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,880
What an unfortunate coincidence.

90
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,680
Do you think it's a coincidence
that Leka's wife is Dardan's cousin?

91
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,480
For years I've been telling you
that the Albanians operate within a family circle

92
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,080
and you can't apply your strict
police rules to them.

93
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,080
For months I've been hearing about laws,
procedures, and rules.

94
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,380
You should be ashamed of the position
you're taking!

95

Yes. There! My weapon!

Call Vienna.

102
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,880
Put Elsa Fischer
under police protection.

103
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,580
A Balkan gangster
and a European Parliament member?

104
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,180
Miss Fischer is connected to this
major privatization,

105
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,080
through the new director of the Kosovo
Privatization Agency.

106
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,680
To put someone of such high rank
under police protection,

107
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,480
a strict procedure must be followed.

108
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,080
You need to send me
a detailed report,

109
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
with which I...

110
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,980
Your pistol is here, in the holster.

111
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Mima is guilty of everything.

112
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,680
So now they're looking for the fugitive?
No.

113
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,080
Now what?

114
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,680
You do nothing. Go home.

115
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,780
See your family,
and I'll find you later.

116
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,680
And what will you do?

117
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,880
I have to finish something.

118
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,580
Inspector Koçi!

119
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,780
What do you want?
I offer assistance.

120
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,880
I know about the destroyed evidence.

121
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,780
Sit down.

122
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,280
Should we negotiate dressed?
What do you have for me?

123
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,680
Where did you get this?
Is that important?

124
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,080
It is important.

125
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,680
It is important to decide whether you will
use it to get to Dardan.

126
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,980
And in return?
Be a little more enthusiastic.

127
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,580
And if you can't, then you're looking for...

128
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,480
Who arranged the weapon
and passports for him? I want him!

129
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,480
There, you see? You can be
enthusiastic.

130
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,080
He is with us now.

131
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,880
But I can't give him to you.

132
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,880
We will get him out of the country.

133
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,380
Agreed?

134
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,480
A deep moral dilemma.

135
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,880
I'll leave all this to you.

136
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,980
Even if you don't want to
cooperate with us. It doesn't matter.

137
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,880
You don't want to screw me.
You don't want to help me.

138
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,680
I might start to appreciate you soon.
Despite being a stupid jerk.

139
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,480
Teuta! Sister!
I'm coming.

140
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,880
I am very happy; with me are
my son and daughter-in-law Aferdita.

141
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,680
And my dear sister Teuta.

142
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,080
A person with such relatives
and friends is a rich person.

143
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,080
Cheers!
Cheers!

144
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,480
I am pregnant... both Ilir and I
will have a baby.

145
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,780
Congratulations!

146
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,680

Congratulations!
Thank you.

149
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,980
Can I say something too?
Of course, sister.

150
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,380
I would like to say a few
words about our family...

151
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,180
...the wonderful Sokoli family...

152
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,780
And for my dear brother, Agim.

153
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,280
Thank you.

154
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,980
You probably think that now you are safe,
now that you are part of the Sokoli family?

155
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,080
You are safe only as long as
you please my brother.

156
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,480
You are safe only until
he betrays us.

157
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,680
Teuta... what are you saying?

158
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,380
Agim organized the assassination
that almost killed my husband

159
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,580
and seriously injured my son.
That's enough!

160
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,680
Word for word, Besa for Besa!

161
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,780
<b>VIENNA</b>

162
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,880
I'll have to cancel the meeting
on the board. Freeze the auction.

163
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,380
You won't cancel anything.

164
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,280
We have to act as if this
has nothing to do with us.

165
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,480
No, I'll call the police.
And what do you plan to tell them?

166
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,080
That this maniac wants
to kill us all.

167
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,780
And so you'll connect us all with him?

168
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,880
In the election year? Our careers
will die just like Agim's.

169
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,980
Do you understand that?
Go home.

170
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,080
Everything will be fine. In this story,
we are on the side of the law.

171
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,080
On the side of civilization.
Far from that wilderness over there.

172
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,880
Fine. See you tomorrow.

173
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,380
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

174
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,180
<b>BELGRADE</b>

175
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,280
Do you want me to give you your jacket?
I don't want your jacket.

176
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,380
I want to make a toast
to my new employers.

177
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,680
And why don't you take your phone
and dial the number?

178
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,680
To brag in person. I just need
to bring more first.

179
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,280
Check the time for me.

180
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,380
What are you doing?
Playing chess.

181
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,780
And who's winning?

182
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,580
What are you doing here?

183
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,080
Luca, come on! Go home,
I'll call you tomorrow.

184
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Go.

185
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,780
Well, exactly as we discussed...

186
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,180
What's happening to you!
Didn't I tell you to...

187
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Hello?

188
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,380
Jon?

189
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Jon?

190
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Hello?

191
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,180
I'm coming.

192
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,180
I want to tell Mom about us.

193
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,980
I want to introduce you to her.

194
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,080
Why?

195
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,480
Because I love you.

196
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,580
Wait here. Okay?

197
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,380
I'll wait.

198
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,980
Mom...
Milichka.

199
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,080
What's going on?

200
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,280
I want to introduce you to someone.

201
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,880
Okay.

202
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,380
We have information that Mima has worked
with the Dardan clan.

203
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,780
Interpol Vienna.
Call them.

204
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,780
Hello?

205
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Yes?

206
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,880
Thank you very much.

207
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,780
We have a new murder.

208
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,380
In Vienna.

209
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,680
Hello?

210
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,380
Agim?

211
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,080
When?

212
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,680
Yon isn't answering his phone.

213
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,880
I don't know where he is.

214
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,480
I understand.

215
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,780
If Ilir says so, I'll leave for Geneva immediately.

216
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,380
Hey, come on!
I'm done with this.

217
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,580
There's no point anymore.
What does that mean now?

218
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,180
Tomorrow I'm resigning!
Alright, wait, calm down.

219
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,080
This isn't the end of the world,
you've given everything...

220
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,580
And what?
Is that supposed to comfort me?

221
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,780
For years, I've been running the office, and? Where are we?
Give me one name that we have?

222
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,480
Uroš Perić.
We only need one piece of evidence...

223
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,680
And what if we have evidence
against Uroš Perić?

224
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,980
Why, what if we have evidence?

225
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,580
Are you messing with me?

226
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,180
Can you hear me, what I'm asking you?

227
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
Huh?

228
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,780
What are you suggesting?
Should I hand over the evidence?

229
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,480
To have them destroyed,
like they destroyed the DNA samples?

230
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,080
No, to use them,
to catch that guy!

231
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,880
I don't understand,
why are you giving up now?

232
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,780
And what will we achieve with this?
We'll put Uroš Perić in prison and?

233
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,980
Will someone new kill for him?

234
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,280
I don't care about Uroš Perić!
Do you understand?

235
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,480
I came to Interpol to destroy
the Berisha clan and catch Dardan!

236
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,380
But you don't want to catch the man
who kills for him?

237
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,880
He's an indirect victim.
So he's innocent?

238
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,380
You don't understand...
You don't understand!

239
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,180
All this time, I've been following you,
because I believe you're acting right.

240
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,680
I can't believe you've hidden
evidence against him from me!

241
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,480
These people killed my father!

242
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,080
They slaughtered him like a pig
in front of my eyes.

243
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,580
I want him. Personally, Dardan!

244
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,780
And I'm not choosing the means anymore.

245
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,480
And what are you suggesting?
To hand over the evidence?

246
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,780
Either you follow the law
or you're with me.

247
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,480
You need to come down.

248
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,080
People are waiting for you. They're coming
to offer their condolences for Teuta.

249
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,680
And until when?

250
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,180
And you know yourself,

251
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,480
our work never ends.

252
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,180
I'm tired...
Right now you need to be strong.

253
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,880
Be strong? For whom?

254
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,460
For Teuta, whom I'm burying...
For Besiana, whom I buried...

255
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,560
or for my maimed son?

256
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,460
This is the price of the work
we do.

257
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,060
I didn't choose this job.

258
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,860
And you know that very well.

259
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,360
Dardane,

260
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,560
we all pay the price for this life.

261
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,860
Ilir will catch up with us soon.

262
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,360
Ilir, Agim's son?

263
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,960
If he dares to come after us, personally,
I'll kill him with my own hands.

264
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,560
And what about Interpol?

265
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,860
After Elsa's death, Petrit will have
the green light to come after us.

266
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,060
Why?
What have I done?

267
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,160
Have I killed someone?

268
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,560
If there's evidence,
arrest the driver in Belgrade.

269
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,860
Dardane, listen to me!
You listen to me.

270
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,760
And hear me well.

271
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,160
I want you to withdraw from everything today.

272
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,760
After Teuta's funeral,
say that you are sick.

273
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,760
Take my sons and lead them
to a safe place.

274
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,960
Give me your word,
that you will protect my sons!

275
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,460
I entrust their care to you.

276
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
You go.

277
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,960
And your affairs, I will finish... alone.

278
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,260
You know,
I won't leave you alone,

279
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,260
until you tell me what's happening?

280
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,860
You already know everything.

281
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,160
So... it's true?

282
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,960
Four murders.
One for each of you.

283
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,260
For Maria, Viden, Una, and for you.

284
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,460
You are foolish, foolish...

285
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,460
Do you think,

286
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,560
that the monster
will leave you alone now?

287
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,560
I will come down here.

288
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,760
Stop here.

289
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,460
Come on.
Wait!

290
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,560
Yes?

You know I've been through a lot in life.

291
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,760
And that you can count my qualities
on the fingers of one hand.

292
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,160
But I'm good at one thing.

293
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,160
I'm good with weapons. And that's why...

294
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,560
From now on, I want you to involve me
in everything that happens.

295
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
Is that clear?

296
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,760
Come on.
We'll talk tomorrow.

297
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,360
Here, a little more.

298
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,260
That's it.

299
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,860
See you tomorrow, right?

300
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,060
Okay, yes.
When I get back from basketball. Okay.

301
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,160
We understand each other.
Come on.

302
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,360
Give me the joint.

303
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,860
You shouldn't smoke!

304
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,060
And you shouldn't kill...

305
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,160
Thinking...
my life wasn't bad.

306
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,160
Well, it wasn't.

307
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,760
We had a great time.

308
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,260
Everything will be okay.

309
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,960
Coupon is waiting for me...

310
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,980
Hey.

311
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,780
What's up?

312
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,380
Misha died.

313
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,280
It's over.

314
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,380
I paid my debt.

315
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,580
Now you are safe.

316
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,780
That's the most important thing.

317
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,180
Dardan can't do anything to you anymore.

318
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,980
And you?

319
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,200
