Previously

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,380
Why? What kind of method is this?

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,680
Blow up a person's grave? You have to admit, it has style.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,780
Could at least be a little more discreet.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,280
Call that idiot.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,080
"Cancer of the Balkans." That's the title.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,680
Dad wants you to leave for there immediately. Okay.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,880
Look at this jerk, what nonsense he writes!

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,380
Our media pumped him up? All of them.

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,080
Dardane. The driver is not the problem.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,680
He's the solution.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,980
"Driver, how is it at home?" For whom?

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,480
For Chelsea. Read my lips.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,680
I shed my blood, blood, and you'll pay it back to me! You'll kill for me 5 people.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,280
One for each of them and then we'll be even.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,180
Give me Besa.

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,780
Here is your Besa!

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,880
Urosh Perich. Mima.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,080
I bring you a gift from Ulcinj, this package.

20
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,780
Hello? Urosh Perich is calling.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,680
ANGELO DINI

22
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,380
Sit down.

23
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,720
Do you want to fuck first or talk?

24
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,620
Whiskey? Sure.

25
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,420
Come on. I'm listening.

26
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,720
No need to be scared. Relax. This is just a regular interview.

27
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,020
Here you go.

28
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,220
Coke, do you want? No.

29
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,420
No? I knew it.

30
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,020
Family man. All the cocaine is mine.

31
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
I love this country!

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,220
Freedom is here. For example, this little bitch here,

33
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,020
do you know who brought her here? Her mother.

34
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,720
This is business. Do you have children?

35
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,020
And you, what do you care?

36
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,920
Well, I'm just asking. Do you have them or not?

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,820
I have a son. He's big.

38
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,020
If you had a daughter, you wouldn't talk like that.

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,820
Bravo! What a specialist you are!

40
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,320
Speak, please. Everything.

41
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,520
How did it come to this misery?

42
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
Where is your restroom?

43
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,620
What's up, Perich? Are you sick?

44
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,820
You need to disappear.

45
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,020
Save yourself while you can.

Okay, didn't she want to break up with him herself?

64
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,080
And now she's mad that you didn't leave him first.

65
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,280
What does it matter? He's an idiot!

66
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Half the day plays games, the other half watches porn.

67

Who does that?

68
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,980
Believe me, it's better this way.

How sweet she is, right?

70
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,480
I'm going to light a cigarette.

Mima. Hey, it's me.

72
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,380
Tell Dardan I couldn't do it.

73
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,780
Didn't I tell you not to use names?

74
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,080
I'm just an ordinary person, not a killer. I can't kill.

Hello? Your mother...

81
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,280
Hello, tell me? Hello, Divna?

82
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,880
I have unusual information from a reliable source.

83
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,180
Two pathologists from Pristina went to Ulcinj a few days ago.

84
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,380
They performed an autopsy on Besiana Berisha.

85
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,880
What autopsy, I don't understand. Why wasn't it done by our pathologist?

86
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,280
Because it was an unofficial autopsy, requested personally by Dardan.

87
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,860
The drug king tests his late daughter for drugs?

88
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,060
Don't worry, I'll investigate. Greetings from Pristina.

89
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,260
Then I'll call you. Bye.

90
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Excuse me, darling.

91
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
Can I get a kiss?

Hello, little sister.

95
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,160
How are you?

96
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,260
Like a dead person who still walks and breathes.

97
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,460
I can imagine...

98
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,660
Go and settle in.

99
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,760

103
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,960

It's your birthday! Happy birthday!

108
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,880
Thank you. Will you take Viden to school?

109
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,580
I'll take him. - Come on, please. And call Una.

110
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,880
I need her. She should come right after school to help me.

111
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,380
I left her a message, she's not answering. - Okay.

112
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,380
And she's making scenes of jealousy! - What jealousy?

113
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,780
I can't believe what's happening!

114
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,280
Finally, she came to the cafe to see who I'm sitting with!

115
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,980
I believe you. - She says, "I'm uncomfortable too,

116
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,280
but wait a minute, you can endure. You need to know that Milos is gay."

117
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
And there's nothing... there's nothing for me to explain who is what.

118
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,480
Okay... Okay, are you listening to me? - I'm listening to you, wait. Sorry.

119
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,580
Come on, pick up that phone. - I can't, my battery is dead.

120
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,280
I've called you a hundred times, it might be important. - What's important?

121
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Should we throw a party for the birthday? It's turning three hundred!

122
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,720
Well, go help her. We'll see you after three hundred years.

123
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,420
We'll talk later! - See you later!

124
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,520
From Mom: CALL ME. IT'S URGENT.

125
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,820
Such an idiot! - Are you okay?

126
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,620
Do you want to kill me, for God's sake? - I'm sorry, please!

127
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
He's broken. - How wouldn't it break?

128
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,620
Okay, I'll buy you a new one. - I don't want you to buy me anything.

129
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,220
So I'm Luka. - What?

130
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Luka.

131
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,720
Una. - Nice to meet you, Una.

132
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,320
Otherwise, Una, you should know that this is not a pedestrian path,

133
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,320
but I'll take responsibility for my actions.

134
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,520
I know. I know both.

135
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,920
Whether I'm guilty, or it's not a pedestrian path?

136
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,820
Both. - Okay, okay.

137
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,920
What can I tell you? - Nothing, be careful how you drive.

138
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,420
Can I at least take you for coffee?

139
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,320
Because of the experienced stress? Please.

140
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
Brandy Skanderbeg...

141
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,420
Good as its creator.

142
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,620
Yes.

143
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,520
You know, how much I respect you...

144
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,620
and appreciate how you treat my sister...

145
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,120
Drive straight!

146
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,920
That dealer.

147
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,120
It's not done like that anymore. - I have nothing to do with it.

148
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,820
There's talk that this scumbag sold ecstasy to our little Besiana.

149
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,520
Please!

150
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,220
Don't listen to everything people say.

151
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,520
I am broken because of her death too, but that doesn't mean we should be killing people on the streets.

152
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,820
Because that way, we'll destroy our families.

153
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,320
We'll destroy our business.

154
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,820
My dead are my concern.

155
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,320
Don't stick your nose in my business!

156
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Except for a big deal that we need to understand.

157
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,620
Brezovica.

158
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,120
We've reached an understanding about Brezovica.

159
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,420
You own it and the consortium managed by my company.

160
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,420
Yes, that's right. To some extent.

161
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,120
Our business is separate.

162
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,820
Except for a big deal. We need to talk about it.

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,620
Brezovica.

164
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,620
We've reached an understanding about Brezovica.

165
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,520
It belongs to me and the consortium managed by my firm.

166
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,120
And that's final!

167
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,120
I think it would be fair for me to benefit from this too.

168
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,420
Let's say about 20%.

169
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,420
And in return...

170
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,620
I propose to help you by taking care of all potential buyers

171
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,620
who could be your competition. You want to help me?

172
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,320
Are you messing with me?

173
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,920
Big deals require big friends.

174
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,720
Think about it.

175
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,920
Boro Zamovich. Escaped from Byalo Pole.

176
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,620
Last year, a member of his gang tried to liquidate him.

177
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,420
Since then, he's been selling ecstasy at sea. Autopsy. I knew there was something.

178
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,420
If you drive at 100 km/h on a dirt road and you're not insane,

179
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,920
probably there's something else.

180
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
Don't forget something? I didn't.

181
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,320
Wounds on the testicles and bite marks,

182
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,820
you mean to say this doesn't fit the mafia?

183
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,220
We don't have an explanation for that. We don't,

184
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,220
but maybe we need to find out who ordered the autopsy?

185
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,420
It was probably someone from the hospital or the police.

186
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,620
Exactly. Let's go.

187
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
MIMA

188
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,620
Hey! Oh, goodness!

189
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,020
Did I scare you? No.

190
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
How was school? It went somehow.

191
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,800
Did you play football? Yes, I scored only four goals.

192
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
MARIA

193
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,100
Come on, get in.

194
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,300
Hello? Did Una call you?

195
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,410
No. She was supposed to be back from school

196
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,510
two hours ago. Who knows where she's wandering again?!

197
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,210
Dad... Dad? Tell me, son?

198
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,610
Why are you upset?

199
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,200
I'm not upset.

200
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm just a little worried that Una hasn't called.

201
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Thanks for the drink. No problem. Thank you.

202
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,000
No, thank you for breaking my phone.

203
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,180
Alright, I'll buy you a new phone. I don't need a phone, really.

204
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,560
No, I insist. No, really. I don't need it.

205
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,130
Fine.

206
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,690
But you can give me a ride home.

207
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,240
Thank you. You're welcome.

208
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,500
Let's do this... Yes?

209
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,660
I'll give you my number, and you can call me if you change your mind.

210
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,630
Alright.

211
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,200
Have you considered my offer?

212
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,400
For the brandy?

213
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,400
I think it's excellent.

214
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,900
As for Brezovitsa... forget it!

215
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,700
I was talking about the brandy.

216
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,800
But it's good you mentioned Brezovitsa.

217
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,570
Goodbye. Who is that guy?

218
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,020
Who are you riding with?

219
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,020
What, should I take the bus for two hours?

220
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,720
How do you know he's normal? You hang out with strangers.

221
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,420
I'm not hanging out. And it's your fault for the rest.

222
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,700
What fault do I have? Una!

223
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,400
What Una?! How are you talking to us?

224
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,320
She sent me a hundred messages! I was responding to her while crossing the street.

225
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,620
I could have died if he hadn't stopped! Alright, nothing happened.

226
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,020
Where's your phone? Here it is.

227
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
It's broken.

228
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,820
He offered to buy me a new one. A stranger will buy you a phone?

229
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,420
He's not a stranger at all. He told me he knows Dad.

230
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,020
Me? Yes. And he sends regards to someone named Mima.

231
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,100
Who is Mima? Who is Mima?

232
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,940
Mother, whatever I heard, I'm telling you.

233
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,340
Who is Mima?

234
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,200
Where are you going?

235
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,300
I'm going... I'm going to the office, I forgot your gift.

236
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,400
Listen to me.

237
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,700
If you have any problems, come to me!

238
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,590
Don't mess with my child!

239
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,090
Don't get involved with her! Fine,

240
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,890
we don't need you. We'll take care of the little one.

241
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,390
Carefully with knives, with roosters. And you'll watch!

242
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,790
Hello?

243
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,420
Here.

244
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,510
It's you again. Didn't I tell you

245
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,710
you have to run away from here?

246
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,910
Alright.

247
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:25,620
Let's do an interview then. I see you're a very dangerous person.

248
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,720
What are you watching?

249
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
What's up, Perich? What are you waiting for?

250
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,020
Come on, shoot!

251
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Shoot! You're not capable of that.

252
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,320
You punk! Look me in the eyes!

253
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,820
Tell me, why didn't the boss send Hashim, but you?

254
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,020
Get lost! I'm disgusted by you, you coward!

255
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Go!

256
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Take me home. Tie me up,

257
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,520
That sweet Una of yours.

258
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,160
Sweet little devil...

259
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,460
Good evening, everyone! Oh, good evening.

260
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,260
Hello. Hi.

261
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,920
I apologize for the delay.

262
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,060
Hello, my love. Happy birthday!

263
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,830
What's there to drink. You have some explaining to do.

264
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,630
I lost the gift somewhere. Damn it. You know...

265
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,500
Do you want cake? No, thanks.

266
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,560
We received an urgent order for quick assistance.

267
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,460
There was no one else to take her except me.

268
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,760
When a person has a perfect marriage, they can afford to be late...

269
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,760
For their wife's birthday. Play something.

270
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,960
Escape attempt?

271
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,660
Otherwise, it will be unlawful detention on your part.

272
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,660
I have grounds. But I rely on your discretion.

273
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,640
I thought the police preserved the innocence of a man.

274
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,420
As if you were unpleasant.

275
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,800
Sex between colleagues doesn't count.

276
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,700
And Todor?

277
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,710
I don't sleep with mafia dogs!

278
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,690
He brought Albanian doctors to perform the autopsy.

279
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,390
But that's your problem now.

280
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,780
Lekich!

281
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,480
Where are you, boss? Do you want kebabs?

282
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,980
I'll have to ruin your meal. If you have to, ruin it.

283
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,760
The autopsy on Besiana Berisha was organized by you.

284
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,860
And it's your responsibility for the dealer's death.

285
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,680
And surely you have evidence for that?

286
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,880
You travel around Europe, spend European money.

287
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,700
You've been chasing Berisha for two years, and then you come here,

288
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,200
to tarnish the honest and honorable Todor!

289
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,400
From this moment, you are suspended. I may not be able to put you in jail,

290
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,500
but I will do everything possible to throw you out of the police.

291
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Don't you want kebabs?

292
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,200
I see that you're better, Mr. Bey.

293
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,660
You are free to go.

294
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,720
And now where to?

295
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,820
What's wrong with you people? I'm a patient, not a damn prisoner!

296
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,360
Am I accused of something?

297
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,400
Thank your consul. He pressured our ministry to release you.

298
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,800
Personally, I would keep you here until I find something to accuse you of!

299
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,260
I have to go to damn Belgrade in a few days. There are no direct flights from this hole.

300
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,530
Bazhdarevich!

301
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,030
Do you smoke weed? Shame!

302
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,990
Good weed, man. Local, Albanian.

303
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,890
It has a wonderful taste.

304
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,060
I'm 99% sure it's Dardan Berisha's merchandise.

305
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,860
Have you tried his heroin? It's mind-blowing.

306
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,720
I don't use. Why not?

307
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,920
What kind of DJ are you then?

308
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,520
What about MDMA? LSD? Ecstasy?

309
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,580
Are you finished? I would like to leave.

310
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:53,180
A few days ago, Dardan Berisha ordered an autopsy on his daughter.

311
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,460
I believe he found something in her body.

312
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,300
Dardan is trying to find the culprit for his daughter's death.

313
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,320
If they found something in her body, I have nothing to do with it.

314
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,220
See, my friend, I believe you... but will Dardan believe you?

315
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,520
By the way...

316
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,920
We found your friend, the dealer, on the beach, castrated.

317
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
Damn it!

318
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,220
What time is it?

319
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,020
Why didn't you wake me up?

320
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,520
Wait, wait.

321
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,020
Hey, watch out! You're defending. You're not defending.

322
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,260
Me? Yes.

323
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,660
Come on, it's your penalty. Are you ready?

324
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,860
Let's go. Like this.

325
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,760
Well done! Just a little bit. Football is bad.

326
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Did you eat anything? No.

327
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
It's a diet. Who's on a diet, huh?

328
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,060
Little mouse! No!

329
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,860
Very good! Well done!

330
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,120
Go get the ball. And apologize to the neighbor.

331
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,520
Go for the ball.

332
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,200
Why did you decide to call me? Did I surprise you?

333
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,400
Well, yes... So, are we going to buy a phone?

334
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,400
You're very bad if you think so.

335
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm kidding. You know what...

336
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
I want to see you.

337
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,900
Well, come then. Bye.

338
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,000
Move it this way.

339
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,000
Where's the money?  I don't have any money.

340
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,460
Is that how it's going to be?

341
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,660
Put his finger here!

342
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,500
Give your finger! Give your finger!

343
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,100
Thank you, darling.

344
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,700
On Monday. The deadline for the bank is expiring.

345
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,340
You forgot. No, I didn't.

346
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,140
Mrs. Kosanovic, "kidnapping" is a strong word.

347
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,280
Don't worry, I'm solving the problem and will call you back.

348
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,560
Someone has to work, you know?

349
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,060
And I work, it's just that... It's like I'm not working.

350
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,360
Save me, brother. How much?

351
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,860
Six grand. Three installments on the loan. Uros, how long will I keep saving you?

352
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,080
We'll see each other tonight.

353
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,780

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,800
Good evening, Mr. Bey. Mr. Berisha wants to talk to you.

355
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'll miss my flights.

356
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,700
He has arranged private transportation for you to the airport.
