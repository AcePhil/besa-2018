00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,180
Previously

2
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,380
Trust me.

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,780
Spill my blood, and you'll get yours.

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,380
You'll kill five people for me.

5
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,280
He's broken. - Luka.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Offered to buy me another. - Some stranger will buy you a phone?

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,380
He's not a stranger; Dad knows him. - Me?

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,880
Yes. And someone named Mima sends regards to you.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,780
Who's Mima? - Listen to me.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,880
If you have any problems, come to me!

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,680
Nice, we don't need you. We'll deal with the little one.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,680
Carefully. With knives, with cocks, and you'll watch.

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,080
Kisses.

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,980
Get lost, I can't stand you! Such a bitch!

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
A few days ago, Dardan Berisha ordered an autopsy of his daughter.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,080
I have nothing to do with it.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,180
Look, I believe you. But will Dardan believe you?

18
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,080
Our business is settled.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,180
There's only one big thing left to settle.

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,980
Don't stick your nose in my affairs!

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,280
Good evening, Mr. Bey. Mr. Berisha wants to talk to you.

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,580
I'll miss my flight. - We'll take you to the airport.

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,480
So... you're David?

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Yes, I am.

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,480
Besi spoke a lot about you.

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,320
Excuse me; you're probably wondering why I wanted to see you.

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,020
It's complicated. You're the last person who saw my daughter alive.

28
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,120
Her last conversation was with you.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,720
What did she say? - Excuse me?

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,820
What were her last words?

31
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,320
That she's fed up with the beach. And she wants to go somewhere else.

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,720
Of course. You should've listened to her.

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,920
That's how it was with all the men in her life. With me, with her brother.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
She is greatly missed.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,520
At one point, I thought you were responsible for Bessiana's death.

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,920
I almost believed you made her drink or take drugs and then left her to drive.

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,320
So, I arranged an autopsy for Bessiana.

38
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,620
And do you know what they found?

39
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Nothing.

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,720
I was ready to tear your heart out with my bare hands.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
And now it seems I owe you an apology.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,320
I was supposed to apologize.

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,120
Now it looks like I owe you an apology.

44
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,420
You thought the same as any father. - That's right.

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,120
Thank you. Thank you for sharing Bessiana's last moment with me.

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,020
Wishing you a pleasant flight.

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
David...

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,220
Did you love her?

49
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,420
Yes.

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,520
Call Belgrade.

51
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,920
Tell them to reactivate the driver.

55
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,080
Hello, sweetheart!

56
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,380
You're very sexy when you're silent.

57
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,380
Why him?

58
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,380
As you're curious, you're even sexier.

59
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,180
How's the company? - Super.

60
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,380
Wait, wait. Turn it off.

61
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,180
Carrier of medicines.

62
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,380
Pharma Trans.

63
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,380
You have a debt of 720,000 to the bank.

64
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,780
How do you know that? - I know everything.

65
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,080
With one click, I can solve your problem and transfer the money.

66
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,380
I don't need your help. - Don't say that; you have a beautiful wife.

67
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,780
And beautiful women run away when companies go bankrupt.

68
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,180
Your daughter is a sweetheart. Born to be fucked by cocks.

69
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,580
Excuse me, but I'd fuck her out of her mind.

70
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,380
If you touch me again, I'll rip your head off!

71
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,680
Stay there before it gets dark.

72
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,580
David left the hotel.

73
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,080
Agim's people? - Yes, from his people.

74
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,880
On our territory?

75
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,480
On our territory, and with goods!

76
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,080
Call Enver.

77
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,980
And be careful. Don't kill them.

78
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,180
The phone.

79
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,580
Get out!

80
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,580
Hey! Do you want me to help you?

81
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,280
Come on, please. Give.

82
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,180
You need a gentle touch, not a man's paw.

83
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,780
And who are you dressing up for?

84
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,480
I'm dressing up for Natasha. We're going out.

85
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,480
Where are you going? Should I come pick you up?

86
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,980
Mind your own business.

87
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,180
No need to come, I'll take the bus back.

88
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,780
No. You'll come back by taxi.

89
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,750
Sure, come on. Thanks.

90
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,740
Please, I don't want everyone to drive you home.

91
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,740
Not everyone will drive me home.

92
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,340
Bye. Bye. Have a good time.

93
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,680
Thank you.

94
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,480
Is this what you've lost?

95
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,080
Yes, it is.

96
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Come in.

97
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,680
I haven't used this perfume in a hundred years.

98
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,480
It was with this perfume, that night at the concert. When we met.

99
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,160
How could you not forget it? I haven't.

100
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,760
Thank you. And...

101
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
There's more.

102
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
This.

103
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,860
If I missed the mark, I can return it immediately.

104
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,260
It's not about that...

105
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,960
Better return it.

106
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,160
What's wrong? You're tickling me.

107
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,160
No, wait. What?

108
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,360
I need to quickly stop by Pavel's. Now?

109
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Yes, right away.  Why?

110
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,760
To get some money. What money?

111
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,960
For the loan. I asked him for a loan. Why ask Pavel again?

112
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,660
Who else? We can borrow from our own, I don't know!

113
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,160
No, no. I've already solved the problem. Wait for me, please. I won't be long.

114
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,460
Well... I have to go. Come on.

115
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,160
Are you going now? Yes, I'm going now.

116
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,660
Unknown number: Same place at 6:30 PM.

117
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,860
Hello. Hello.

118
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,960
You look older. And you look younger.

119
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,360
Come in. Thank you.

120
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,760
Tell me, what will you drink?

121
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,380
Rosé spritzer.

122
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,780
Nice restaurant you have.

123
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,280
Thank you. Where did you get it?

124
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,980
From my father.

125
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,480
Come in.

126
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,280
What's this?

127
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,080
What I promised you.

128
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,280
And what did I say?

129
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,780
You'll come out very persistent.

130
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,780
What can I do, that's how I am.

131
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,580
Come in.

132
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,280
Alright.

133
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,780
What's wrong? What's the problem?

134
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,380
I'm not like that.

135
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,680
Everyone is like that. It's a matter of motivation.!

136
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,180
Do you remember the case of the abducted child

137
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,680
with Dr. Todorovich, a few years ago?

138
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,580
You read about it, it was in all the newspapers.

139
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,080
They say they still haven't found the child.

140
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,580
They're lying. They found him.

141
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,420
Dr. Todorovich found him personally.

142
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Every week, I sent him a piece of it.

143
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,620
So he could put it back together.

144
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,920
I returned his son.

145
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,120
Come on. Finish your job.

146
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,020
MARIA

147
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,120
Baby, are you still awake?

148
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,420
Are you ready to go? Baby?

149
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,820
Mother...

150
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,220
Get up, you fucking bitch!

151
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,920
Wake up, you sleepy cunt!

152
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,020
Who are you, huh?

153
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,720
I didn't order room service, get lost!

154
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,420
When you kill for the first time, you vomit.

155
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,320
The second time is easier. You can even have an espresso.

156
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,320
The third time, you start to like it.

157
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,320
Soon you'll understand.

158
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,820
Drink? I'm messed up.

159
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,820
Me too. Where are we going?

160
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,620
Let's go home. Come on again.

161
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
Where are we going?

162
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,020
Lead the way.

163
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,220
And what would you do? What would I do?

164
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,920
I would go up to the balcony and that's it.

165
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
I would... I'm late, sorry.

166
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,320
Ah, here's the third for the cards.

167
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,420
No, I think you're wrong.

168
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,020
You're wrong again. He didn't come to play cards.

169
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,420
He doesn't care to see his friends.

170
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,620
Something else matters to him.

171
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,220
Do you have something to drink?

172
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Just let me clear this. Sorry. You're fine.

173
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,220
And? Now is the time to say "thank you."

174
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,520
What is this?

175
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
Thank you, brother! I don't know, how many times you saved me. You're great!

176
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,320
Thank you. Thank you.

177
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,920
So, I have cytostatics, but they're not that great.

178
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,520
Whiskey, homemade brandy. Give the homemade to the homebodies.

179
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,220
Do you remember that summer, the last one before the war?

180
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,420
At the international camp in Rovin, we were still kids.

181
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,020
The whole world was at our feet And then, everything went to hell.

182
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,420
16 years old, at the peak of life. Madness, complete madness.

183
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,320
Remember? I do.

184
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,320
Alright, come on...

185
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,520
Come on, those two girls over there.

186
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,920
I don't know. Come on, check them out carefully.

187
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,120
I can't. Watch them.

188
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Tequila... - Alright.

189
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,520
Watch now, add soda, fill the glass. Watch now!

190
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,820
Boom-boom. What were you drinking in high school?

191
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,820
Come on again. Come...

192
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,920
Come on, see this. What's the boy doing?

193
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,820
Kahlúa... And now gently and carefully pour Baileys on top.

194
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,520
So that it stays on top, like foam, floating.

195
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Baby Guinness. Like a little beer. - Bravo.

196
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Excellent for a mother. - Sorry, but I'm a single mother

197
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,520
and I need to be informed. And you know nothing.

198
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,420
I'm used to brandy.

199
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,420
I have nothing against brandy, as long as it doesn't bother you later.

200
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,920
But there are so many drinks, one has to try different things.

201
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,720
I don't want to mix brandy with anything else, if it's not a problem.

202
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,520
Should it be a problem? All problems around you.

203
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,320
We've come out for a drink, to relax.

204
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,320
A person can't just work, Koči.

205
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,620
So you want to talk about me. - If you want to talk about me.

206
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,420
I'm a single mother, my life is an inexhaustible topic.

207
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,520
Are you okay? I mean...

208
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,020
Is everything in order? - Everything is absolutely, perfectly...

209
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,320
...foolishness. Which you probably have no way of knowing.

210
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,320
What?

211
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,520
And you avoid such things too.

212
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,520
Well, if I have a story too? - Is it sad?

213
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,320
I don't know. I'll tell you, and you'll decide.

214
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,120
I'm listening.

215
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,520
I had a friend who studied in Belgrade.

216
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,820
He fell in love with... - a girl from a respected Belgrade family.

217
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,420
Everything was great until his intentions became serious.

218
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,200
Everything fell apart when they broke up.

219
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,100
What happened? - They broke up, and that was it.

220
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,900
Why? - Because, my friend

221
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
wasn't Serbian enough.

222
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm sorry. - For what?

223
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,510
I'm not sorry. I mean...

224
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,210
The important thing is that my friend is better now.

225
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,610
He doesn't think about it anymore. Now he thinks about other things.

226
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,910
Like what?

227
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,210
About the wounds on the body of the late Italian journalist.

228
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,600
About the caliber of the weapon used, about the style of elimination.

229
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,300
I want you to find me all the information

230
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,500
on professional mafia killings in the past year.

231
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,900
I'll do it right away.

232
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,100
Finish your drink. You still have more.

233
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,900
For the road. - Alright.

234
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,100
You're going home. - Hey!

235
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,880
I don't want to go home.

236
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,560
Where do you want to go?

237
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,430
Let me drive you home.

238
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,490
Welcome.

239
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,440
This place seems familiar to me.

240
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,500
And I need something unfamiliar.

241
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,460
Good night and sweet dreams.

242
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,530
Good night.

243
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,730
And don't forget your bag.

244
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,630
I've got my bag.

245
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,930
Bye.

246
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,900
Good night.

247
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Good night.

248
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,300
Dad? Yes?

249
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Are you okay? Yes, yes.

250
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,900
Are you sure? Yes.

251
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,400
Come and open the door for me, please.

252
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,800
What's wrong with you? I feel nauseous.

253
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,000
Do you need anything? No. Are you sure?

254
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Yes. Are you sure?

255
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,300
Come on, go to bed. Okay.

256
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,500
Good night.

257
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,270
<b>OHRID</b>

258
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,020
Quiet! Quiet! Speak! Where is the drugs? Where?

259
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,520
In the trunk... In the trunk.

260
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,920
Quiet... Shut your mouth, or I'll clean you up!

261
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,220
You seem smarter to me, so I'm talking to you...

262
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,920
Be silent. Silent!

263
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,200
Come on... quickly!

264
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,000
Put her inside.

265
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,620
Give my regards to Agim.

266
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,320
Did you take everything you need?

267
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,220
Inspector Koci. General Premovic.

268
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Inspector Dukic. Jovic.

269
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,220
What are you doing here?

270
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,120
I was called by the British Embassy.

271
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,420
You understand that this is also the work of Dardan Berisha?

272
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,900
Possible.

273
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,640
I would like you to join us.

274
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,840
How nice of you! Jovic?

275
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,600
The girl who was with him found his body in the morning.

276
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
The door was locked,

277
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,100
and the card - a key was placed in the electricity socket.

278
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,100
So we assume the Englishman knew the killer.

279
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,300
The attacker shot on the move.

280
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,790
The Englishman ran towards the bathroom.

281
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,090
One bullet is in the pillow, and two more in the picture on the wall.

282
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,490
There's another one in the door frame safe. All the rest are in him.

283
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,190
Very strange! What's strange?

284
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,990
There are too many bullets.

285
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,220
The attacker missed a lot of shots from close range.

286
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,110
He acted like an amateur.

287
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:26,710
Or he got scared. Or he wanted to look that way.

288
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,310
I received some video. Probably from the cameras.

289
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,720
Play it.

290
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,020
This is not going well!

291
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,720
Bad news from Macedonia.

292
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,620
Dardan's people intercepted the Dauti brothers in Ohrid.

293
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,020
They took 50 kilograms from them.

294
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Well done. Did they beat them?

295
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,420
They wounded one in the leg. Sending you greetings.

296
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,920
Well done. It's time for you to go to Montenegro.

297
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,320
Get ready. We're paying a visit.

298
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,620
Hey! What are you preparing?

299
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,820
Let me see! What?

300
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,020
Let me see! What?

301
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,620
Do you know how scared Viden got when he saw your bruises? Show me!

302
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,460
He promised me that they won't bother us anymore, right?

303
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,760
You're wrong. This has nothing to do with the mafia.

304
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,760
I argued with some people in the traffic jam, and they beat me up.

305
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,660
Urose, I'm not a fool! Don't mutter to me and don't lie to me!

306
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,260
You will ruin everything we have.

307
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,060
You're right. No, don't...

308
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,760
No, really. I shouldn't have lied to you.

309
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,460
I just didn't want to worry you. Urose...

310
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,460
I didn't want you to worry. Do you understand?

311
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,860
You look so sexy with that board!

312
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,760
Are the kids here? I don't know, they should be at school.

313
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Let's see.

314
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,960
Good day, Good day, Mrs. Peric.

315
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,560
Inspectors Petrit Koci and Divna Dukic from Interpol.

316
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,060
Is your husband at home?
