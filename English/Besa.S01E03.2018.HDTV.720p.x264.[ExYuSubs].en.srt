1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,880
Besi, calm down! You'll get angry!

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,680
This is him.

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,380
What's up? We have a problem.

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,780
If I let him go to Belgrade,

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,280
how do you think Dardan Berisha will react?

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,780
They lifted him into the air. He's connected to torture,

7
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,480
human trafficking, and murder. Plus, we have Besa.

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,580
Call the frog. If they pay you killers, we'll pay the media.

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,480
"The Cancer of the Balkans," that's the headline.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,080
My father wants you to go there right away. - Okay.

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,380
My condolences. Thank you.

12
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,380
The boss is looking for you.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,680
Uros? Pavle? Uros is gone!

14
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,580
Boro! Kill the driver with your bare hands!

15
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,880
I'm not guilty! Hey! It's not at fault!

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,180
I'm not...

17
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,780
Uncle, did he arrive? You shouldn't kill him.

18
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,580
Why? Dardan, let him go.

19
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,480
You know he's not guilty.

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,680
He's just a poor guy. I saw the blood analysis.

21
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,980
I didn't see anything.

22
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,080
If you kill him, everyone will know it was you.

26
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,780
Look at this, how much nonsense he writes!

27
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,380
Have our media burst him?

28
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,180
All of them. Read!

29
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,380
"The funeral of the young, tragically deceased Besiana Berisha,

30
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,280
was a first-class social event in this part of the Balkans."

31
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,180
"The criminal elite of the region,

32
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,680
rushed to honor the deceased daughter of the head of the Berisha clan."

33
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,780
"People from the most corrupt government in Europe,

34
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,880
came to pay their respects to the man..."

35
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,180
"At RAQA, who with his bloody hands rules Kosovo and Montenegro,

36
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,380
and controls the entire drug traffic to Europe."

37
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,980
"The fact that this man and his friends with dubious capital

38
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,780
will soon privatize everything that is worth something,

39
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,180
clearly shows the darkness that this region is sinking into."

40
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,480
Damn him, I should've cleaned him up!

41
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,880
And I just kicked him out.

42
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,980
To kill at a funeral?

43
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,080
What they write...

44
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,880
It only applies to Agim.

45
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,280
It's definitely his doing.

46
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,280
I'll kill them all.

47
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,080
Both the driver and the Italian journalist.

48
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,280
I'll call Mehmed from Munich. He's fast and reliable. He works well.

49
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,250
At this moment... a hired killer?

50
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,640
When we have Interpol on one side and Agim on the other?

51
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
This is madness.

52
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Dardan!

53
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,140
The driver is not the problem. He is the solution.

54
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,640
Better use him.

55
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,480
I don't see another option. Only this one.

56
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,880
Mare... Should we go to the police?

57
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,380
My love!

58
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,780
Let's go home.

59
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,560
It smells so good, and you're still cooking!

60
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,260
How are you? Somehow.

61
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,360
Won't you tell me? What?

62
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
What what?

63
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,160
Where were you that night?

64
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,360
I don't know why you won't tell me.

65
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,060
It was a misunderstanding.

66
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,460
I got kidnapped. Kidnapped?

67
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,860
It was a misunderstanding? Who kidnapped you?

68
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,060
The father of that girl. Why didn't we call the police?

69
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,160
We left without telling the police. I'll call Pavel.

70
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
You won't call Pavel... Why?

71
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,960
Because I don't want the mafia to come knocking on our door.

72
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,460
Who knows what these people will do to us now?!

73
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,060
Nothing will happen to us. If they wanted,

74
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
they could have killed me that night.

75
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,460
We're safe.

76
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,760
Daughter-in-law, it was fantastic! And nobody praises me!

77
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,560
Oh, praise her! Otherwise, see what will happen to you!

78
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,860
Come on, enjoy a little more. What are you grumbling about? Eat.

79
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,160
I'm eating, can't you see? She's anorexic.

80
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,760
Don't be like that. Leave your sister alone. Tell me,

81
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,460
are you still for OFK Belgrade? What OFK?

82
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
I'm for Chelsea now. For who?

83
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
For Chelsea. Read my lips.

84
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Unknown number. You have a message.

85
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,760
C-H-E-L-S-E-A. Chelsea.

86
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,160
Hello, driver. How's home?

87
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,080
Didn't I say that too? He didn't say that...

88
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,280
Chelsea from Marinkova is asking! No, it's from England.

89
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,180
What was the name of that footballer, a small one, shaking everyone up?

90
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,580
Come on, grandpa. Leave the kids to have dinner.

91
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,380
I won't cook for you anymore, since nobody is eating!

92
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,480
How can we not eat? You're just talking; the dinner is ruined!

93
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,280
I eat as much as I can! That's why you're so skinny.

94
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,480
Driver!

95
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,980
Come, come closer.

96
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,580
Don't be afraid. I won't do anything to you.

97
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,580
Come here.

98
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,580
How are you?

99
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,880
Family dinner?

100
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,080
Family is the most important thing in the world.

101
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,780
I would do anything for my family. And you for yours?

102
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,280
I also would. I believe you.

103
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,620
You have Maria, Viden...

104
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,020
Una... Is this your father?

105
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,720
Bojo, right?

106
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,420
Choose!

107
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,220
What should I choose?

108
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Spill my blood, and I'll return yours!

109
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,320
Hard. Is it hard, huh?

110
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,620
Won't you give?

111
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,120
It's hard for me too!

112
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Look...

113
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,820
I'll give you another chance. You'll kill five people for me.

114
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,420
Kill for yourself. And can you kill for them too?

115
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,420
One for each of them, and then we'll be even!

116
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,620
If not, you know what I have to do!

117
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,720
Kill me right now. Let's end this.

118
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,120
I don't want to kill you.

119
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,820
I'll let you live and watch. Hashim!

120
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,520
He says he tracked your daughter to the school.

121
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,820
He could have fooled her, but don't worry, for now, he has only watched her.

122
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,220
Shall we knock on the door and have a little fun?

123
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
I have to tell you, Afrim is a good guy, but a little crazy.

124
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,520
And he screws anything he gets. Come on. No, no, wait... Stop, hey...

125
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,720
I'll do it.

126
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,520
I'll do whatever you want.

127
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,220
You're a reasonable person. Let's see what kind of killer you are!

128
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,220
Okay. So if I do what you want,

129
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,820
you'll leave us alone?

130
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,620
You have no choice. You have to trust me.

131
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Trust you?

132
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
You'll have to.

133
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,820
Give me Besa.

134
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,020
You want my Besa?

135
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,520
Kill my daughter, and you want my Besa?

136
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,520
Here is your Besa!

137
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,520
Driver?

138
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,620
Be ready!

139
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,420
Son or daughter? Son.

140
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Boss?

141
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,520
I'll leave on my own. Enough of this nonsense, Jole!

142
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,620
Your wife is giving birth. Who will drive today to Vršac?

143
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,320
I will. Come on, get going.

144
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Take care.

145
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,720
I have to tell you something.

146
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,020
But don't get nervous.

147
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,220
They called from the bank. We're behind on the loan installment.

148
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,220
We don't have enough in the account for both the loan and the salaries.

149
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,320
First, pay the salaries. And the loan?

150
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,420
I'll talk to them.

151
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,720
Good morning, inspector! Good morning.

152
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,220
How are you?

153
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,120
Boro Zamović, an old acquaintance.

154
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,320
He's been in the force for 10 years, which is a third of his life.

155
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,320
Beatings, extortion, drug trafficking.

156
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,620
For whom? For brothers, relatives, and friends.

157
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,820
But that's about you. Up north. And what is he doing here in Ulcinj?

158
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,820
Ulcinj is a tourist town. It's full of people.

159
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,320
Someone beat him up. Dardan's people.

160
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,720
Someone bit his left testicle.

161
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,420
Gentlemen, I also want to nail Dardan, but...

162
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,320
This is the work of some jealous wife or some crazy person.

163
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,020
Mirko.

164
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,020
What is this? A warrant for Hashim's arrest.

165
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,920
Hashim? Watch your balls, Todor.

166
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,920
Are you okay? What?

167
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,020
You've lost weight. Thank you for noticing.

168
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,900
What did you find out about the deceased? Nothing important.

169
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,300
He was a small-time dealer, Montenegrin. Down towards Ulcinj.

170
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I wonder, what does this small-time dealer have to do with Dardan's dead daughter?

171
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,610
Yes. And what does the blood analysis of Besijana Berisha show?

172
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,810
I think she wasn't tested.

173
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,610
Only for alcohol. And now it's too late.

174
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,010
Learn what you can about this Boro and the Zamović brothers from White Field.

175
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,510
All right.

176
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,010
I shouldn't have divorced, I should have shot him!

177
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,200
I need to go get the child. How is she?

178
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,600
She's fine. We'll talk later, okay?

179
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
You three are so little.

180
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,200
Mom... can we play a little now? Okay, but put on your headphones. Okay.

181
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,660
Go.

182
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,830
This won't help. And what will help?

183
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,690
Besian's death is vengeance.

184
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,840
God's punishment for the dirty deeds you and my brother are involved in.

185
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,100
My brother and I are doing what needs to be done.

186
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,560
It's not like that. Think... Think well. We have enough money.

187
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,330
Think well... We have enough money.

188
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,200
Maybe it's time to start a normal life somewhere else?

189
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,100
You know very well that you can't leave this business.

190
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,700
You knew that even when you married me.

191
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Are you saying when I was married off to you?

192
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,800
I didn't mean to offend you. You haven't offended me.

193
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,400
Agim called me.

194
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm leaving for Shkodra tomorrow. Come with me if you want.

195
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,700
Here, Maria sent you your favorite Croatian stew.

196
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Great!

197
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,070
Life is good, old lady!

198
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,270
What's good about it?

199
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,120
Why, what's good? Both of us haven't even hit fifty yet,

200
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,820
and we already have a new best friend.

201
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,020
Death, brother. Death.

202
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,800
It hit me in the lymph nodes, you in the brain...

203
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,720
I almost died in Montenegro. My wife acts like a detective.

204
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,020
The bank is squeezing my balls. I've never been so stuck...

205
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,220
Are you okay?

206
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
Misho?

207
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:44,500
Breathe! Misho, come on! Breathe, damn it!

208
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,740
Come on! Are you okay?

209
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,140
I'm fine, brother. Every day, I add a little gas.

210
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,000
I feel it growing.

211
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,900
It doesn't matter, a little more and it'll be over.

212
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,300
Do you think we'll have time for another basketball game before I kick the bucket?

213
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,500
Like this, with my pajamas, shooting a three-pointer to loosen my ass?

214
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,500
What... have you already made peace with life?

215
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,900
You talk like a dead man, but you're alive!

216
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,200
You're alive, and as long as you can, you have to fight this crap!

217
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Don't give up, live!

218
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,290
And what do you think?

219
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,390
That if you argue with cancer, will it run away?

220
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,690
And you... what did you start to say? I interrupted you.

221
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,690
Nothing.

222
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,220
Call Todor.

223
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,910
He's calling me tomorrow morning for an interrogation at the police.

224
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,110
Petrit ordered it.

225
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:20,010
Go. Okay.

226
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:25,110
Todor is offering his, as he said, "sincerest apologies."

227
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,320
Damn policeman.

228
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,820
And you... be peaceful there!

229
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,020
Behave yourself.

230
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,920
Did you prepare things for the driver in Belgrade?

231
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,420
Of course. Do you want me to do something for the Englishman?

232
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,620
No. We'll wait.

233
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Did you and the mechanic decide to be with us?

234
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,920
By Monday, we have to pay all the installments with interest,

235
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,620
Otherwise, they will initiate forced collection.

236
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,620
What are we going to do? I don't know.

237
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,220
I'll borrow from someone. I suppose.

238
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,120
Someone is waiting for you in the office. He owns two pharmacies in Vršac. Wants to talk business.

239
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,560
Good day. Uroš Perić.

240
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,760
Mima.

241
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
You're sweating.

242
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,920
Come in. Thank you.

243
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,560
My secretary said you have two pharmacies in Vršac.

244
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,230
I don't have any pharmacies.

245
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:00,130
I have a gift, this package. With regards from Ulcinj.

246
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,900
Milica, open the box!

247
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,360
Open it!

248
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,960
Now you have my phone number.

249
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,460
The address is on the back of the photo.

250
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,760
You have until Monday.

251
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,660
Why? What kind of method is this? To blow up someone's grave?

252
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,760
Now everyone knows that the mole has no peace even in the grave.

253
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,360
What do they know? That you're crazy, that you don't care about anything?

254
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,840
Don't talk like that, for God's sake, you'll destroy your family, your business, everything.

255
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Agi is only waiting for this!

256
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,920
And when people find out? And what if they find out?

257
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,200
And Brezovica? What about Brezovica?

258
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,700
We've talked a hundred times that we need to leave something great for our children.

259
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,310
Only then will we prove that we have been someone and something.

260
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,690
Am I the problem? Me?

261
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,090
Do you think I'm crazy?

262
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,680
Uncle, do you remember what he asked of me,

263
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,380
when they locked you up, and my brother Ramu was killed?

264
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,480
I remember. I was only 17.

265
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,280
With my own hands, I buried my brother.

266
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,160
And on whose shoulders did everything fall when they killed my brother?

267
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,560
All the work, all the responsibilities... fell on me.

268
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,180
If I hadn't been so crazy, Agi would have taken everything from us.

269
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,680
He would have left us with empty hands.

270
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,600
Listen, uncle!

271
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:21,300
You're my uncle, I love you and respect you,

272
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,600
but don't come here anymore to tell me what to do.

273
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,600
Dardane, you didn't understand me.

274
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,600
I'm not telling you what to do, but as God, I beg you,

275
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,760
to take account of yourself. Just that.

276
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,320
Don't worry. I'm taking account of myself.

277
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,620
We know you killed Boro.

278
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,260
And those other two in the bay.

279
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,500
We also know that Enver lifted the protected witness into the air.

280
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,100
Now we just need to figure out which one of you idiots left your DNA at the crime scene.

281
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Do you know what I don't understand?

282
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,050
What do you gain from all this? Hashim, how does this sound to you?

283
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,830
How does this sound? Sounds good!

284
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,030
Hashim will soon own half of Kosovo, and you?

285
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,990
I have nothing. No wife, no kids.

286
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,660
Are you a fag? Dardan's fag?

287
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,060
The lab report will show your traces, not his, Hashim.

288
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,520
But I have a proposal.

289
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,620
Give testimony against Dardan. You'll become a protected witness.

290
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,920
And you'll choose where you want to live.

291
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,080
You love dicks, right? A black one, a Swedish one, choose!

292
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,980
I suppose I want a black cock!

293
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,080
Or a cock of some Viking?

294
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,860
What? Didn't we establish that I'm a fag?

295
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,000
Give me a cigarette. I feel like smoking.

296
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,020
And?

297
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,320
How does that sound to you? It sounds good!

298
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,920
But it just sounds!

299
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,620
And do you know what sounds better? What?

300
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,320
Shall I tell you, or...

301
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Tell me.

302
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,720
Tell me!

303
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:54,620
The story sounds better of how your father shit himself in fear,

304
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,420
before our guys cleaned him up.

305
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,920
It happened that they had to kill him shitting.

306
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,160
Like a dog.

307
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,760
You can go.

308
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,820
I said you can go.

309
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,000
Clean that up.

310
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,200
I came to say goodbye.

311
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm going back to Kosovo. So fast?

312
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,800
Dardan! I won't stay where I'm not useful.

313
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,500
Come with me. Here, no one knows who's drinking and who's paying.

314
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,300
You have a wife and sons to take care of.

315
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,100
I buried Besiana here. We'll bury her there.

316
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,060
Hello? Yes?

317
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,700
Yes, yes, I hear.

318
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,700
Of course, right away!

319
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,900
Good. Bye.

320
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,340
Good morning, Thomas. Good morning, please come in.

321
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,740
Thank you.

322
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,380
This man was going to testify.

323
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,860
And he blew up his grave. Does it seem funny to you?

324
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,560
You have to admit, he's got style.

325
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,860
You put this man as president of the foundation and at the head of Brezovica.

326
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,660
And now you want to cut him off? Can he at least be a bit more discreet?

327
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,480
Discretion is not inherent in these people.

328
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,380
From the very beginning, since the war, this man does what we tell him to.

329
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,880
With him, we are the first in line for the privatization of this country.

330
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,620
And now you want to cut him off? Maybe he could be a little more discreet.

331
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,170
Discretion is not inherent in these people.

332
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,870
But obedience is. And I have a few obedient ones at hand.

333
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,400
Can they control him? No.

334
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,200
But they can persuade him that sometimes new ways are better than the old ones.

335
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,400
Seriously. Our friend is not a man you can play with.

336
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,000
Thomas, please go.

337
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,300
No, no. I understand everything.

338
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,000
I'll borrow from someone else. I know.

339
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,400
I know what the tax authorities do. Hold on.

340
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,500
Hello? Uroš Perić is calling.

341
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,400
Oh, my friend! What do I owe this honor to?

342
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,400
You told me you would come to Belgrade. Remember, you gave me a business card?

343
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,200
Yes, yes. And how is your sexy wife, huh?

344
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,400
You wouldn't dare to talk in front of her. I understand.

345
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,720
Something like that. Let's meet at 10.

346
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,300
Okay? And 300 euros will be enough, right? For you?

347
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,300
Okay. And you can hook up with some chick here,

348
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,600
with me, if you want. My treat.

349
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,200
Until next time. Let's go.

350
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,100
How did it go?

351
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,300
Okay.  What is this?

352
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,600
Petrite.  Why?

353
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,000
Provoked me.

354
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,500
I told you to be calm.

355
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,000
There you go... This is for you and your mom.

356
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,900
Like this... Where are you... Here you are! Here...

357
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,900
