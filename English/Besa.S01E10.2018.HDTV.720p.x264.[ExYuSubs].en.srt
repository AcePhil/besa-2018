<i>Show some manners.</i>

<i>Let's talk in the yard.
This is the last time I'm dealing with you!</i>

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
<i>Clear?  Sure.</i>

00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,180

<i>Go home.</i>

<i>Who was it?
Your brother-in-law!</i>

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,580
<i>We got approval from the minister.
Prepare the people.</i>

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,980
<i>To everyone! Take positions
for the operation.</i>

13
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,980
<i>Find Dardan!
Good day, Inspector Koci.</i>

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,580
<i>Where is Dardan?
I'm taking two corpses to Podgorica.</i>

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,180
<i>They'll be buried tomorrow.
Come on, run.</i>

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,980
<i>Run away from here.
Save yourself!</i>

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,680
<i>What kind of person would shoot at children?</i>

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,980
<i>Does he have a soul, a conscience?
What kind of person is this?</i>

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,380
And where is Dardan Berisha now?

20
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,480
Perhaps we would have
this information,

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,080
if the chief prosecutor of Montenegro
had not refused this morning

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,480
to arrest Skender Berisha and his people
and bring charges against them.

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,180
We can't press them constantly, Koci.

24
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,480
Forget about it and try
to find Dardan Berisha.

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,880
That's why I'm here.

26
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,280
Skender remains free.

27
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,580
See, I've already checked half
of the Belgrade high schools for this guy

28
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,580
and nothing, but something else very important
came to my mind.

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,580
For example, what happened
that Hashim disappeared so suddenly?

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,880
This could mean...
Keep searching.

34
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,180
Yes.

35
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,380
We sent you the documents via email.
Everything is verified.

36
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,480
My source from the privatization agency
confirmed it.

37
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,680
So, war?

38
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,580
Blood is already being shed. The murder
in Rovin is definitely related to this.

39
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,280
Agani was a decoy for Agim.

40
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,580
Only Dardan has a motive. He found out
that this one is a candidate for the auction.

41
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,180
Where did he find out?
He speaks Serbian.

42
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,780
The documents were submitted
48 hours before the murder.

43
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,880
My only person had access
to this information, and he's clean.

44
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,880
What about the German?

45
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,180
The one who leads the fund.
Well, we need to check him.

46
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,080
Avdi. See what you can dig up.
Okay.

47
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,580
The laboratory analysis from Lyon
has arrived.

48
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,780
And?

49
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,380
The DNA sample from Rovin completely
matches the other DNA samples.

50
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,580
So, we have the killer.

51
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,480
We just need to find out who he is.

52
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,980
Divna... the veins.
The veins!

53
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,080
Is this some new method?
Yes, it is. The latest.

54
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,980
To get enlarged veins
while I search through all the archives.

55
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,880
The newcomers who came here
are now against the government.

56
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,880
Good thing someone
remembered to dig into...

57
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
And was this some specialized
opposition high school?

58
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,780
Oh, no. There were also people from the authorities.

59
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,280
All generations have passed through here
since 1858.

60
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,280
I won't keep you any longer,
I'll return the key to the director.

61
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,980
Thank you.
- Some of the diaries,

62
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,280
have long been destroyed.
Thanks to the former authorities.

63
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,780
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

64
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,580
What wouldn't I give to soak
apricots in the sea once again.

65
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,180
Damn the sea!

66
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,080
True, now you enjoy
killing people.

67
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,280
Maria has gone crazy.

68
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,180
I told her everything.

69
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,580
Mare!

70
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Mare!

71
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,380
Mare! Get up, Mare!

72
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,380
What are you doing here?

73
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,480
Don't overdo it with those pills,
they'll fry your brain.

74
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,480
Leave, or I'll...
I'll call the police!

75
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,780
Really?
And what, you'll tell them everything?

76
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,080
And do you gnash your teeth when
you have to kill someone?

77
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,180
Are you deaf?
I told everything to Maria.

78
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,980
And?

79
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,280
Now she acts like everything is fine
in front of the kids.

80
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,780
But I know we...
But I know we are separated.

81
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,780
It's strange, you tell your wife
that you kill people,

82
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,380
and she gets mad at you.

83
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,380
Oops! Good day, Ivan Bilich!

84
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,780
Won't someone sing for you?

85
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,780
Like Maria, for example? No.

86
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,480
I reached an agreement with Uros to tell you.

87
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,680
Everything.

88
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,480
I believe that in a marriage
there should be no secrets.

89
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,680
Marriage is a sacred union. You'll
forgive me, but I'm old-fashioned.

90
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,480
Did he tell you? What did he say?

91
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,180
It would be tough, brother.
You come home one evening,

92
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,880
after some murder, and your wife comes
and says, "Honey, I called the police!"

93
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,180
Wait, what will you do?
Will you clean her?

94
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,980
He told me he owes money to someone.

95
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,380
If it's you, we'll settle!
- No, look, there's no need...

96
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,180
The two of us will handle it.

97
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,180
All day I call him, and he
doesn't answer. Where is he?

98
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,280
At his friend's.
- At the one dying of cancer?

99
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,280
Well, then I have to hurry,
catch him while he's still alive.

100
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,380
Greetings to the kids.

101
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,980
I fell in love with the boy...

102
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,780
And I don't miss the girl.

103
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,680
Goodbye, Mare!

104
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,080
Where is Petrit?
- He's not here, he's in the bathroom.

105
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,180
I don't have time for this. Do you know
who was Ivan Bilich's classmate?

106
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
Who?

107
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,180
Uros! Uros Perich.

108
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,580
There's no chance he's the killer!

109
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,580
He probably went to Rovinj
because of some chick.

110
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,280
That's quite manly logic.

111
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,480
Petrit, please! Come on, believe me.
Just trust me.

112
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,780
We need to check Perich.

113
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,080
Mr. Perich, thank you
for coming.

114
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,080
I didn't have much choice.
- Actually, you had no choice.

115
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Okay. Mr. Perich, when was the last time
you were in Croatia?

116
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,680
Am I suspected of something?
- No, no.

117
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,780
Because if I am, I would like
to talk to my lawyer.

118
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,280
You don't need a lawyer,
we're just talking.

119
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,980
You don't need a lawyer
to answer us, right?

120
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,480
Well, tell me about Croatia...

121
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,880
And why do you want to know?
- Answer.

122
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,880
Well, I was in Croatia...

123
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,480
6 months ago.

124
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,880
Mr. Perić, do you know Ivan Bilić?
- No.

125
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,480
Are you sure?
- Yes.

126
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,780
Actually... that was the name
of a classmate of mine from high school.

127
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,380
Doesn't he still have that name?
- Most likely he still does.

128
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,180
Unless he took his wife's last name.
- I haven't seen him since 1991. He moved to Croatia back then.

129
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,980
Ivan Bilić was killed
7 days ago in Rovinj.

130
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,880
We think the same person who killed
Mehmet Agani killed him.

131
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,380
Ivan Bilić was your friend?
- Ivan and I went to school together,

132
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,380
We hoped that you could help us
with the investigation.

133
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,980
And who is Ahmet Agani?
- Mehmet Agani.

134
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,680
Mehmet.
- Croatian businessman.

135
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,180
Associate of Agim Sokoli, the eccentric
friend of your friend Dardan Berisha.

136
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,580
You very well know that
Dardan Berisha is not my friend.

137
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,180
And Ivan was your friend?
- Ivan and I studied together,

138
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,780
I told you, we haven't seen each other
in a hundred years

139
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,480
and it can't be said
that he was my friend.

140
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,080
Mr. Perić, what were you doing
in Rovinj ten days ago?

141
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,580
I haven't been to Rovinj in 10 years.

142
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,080
Yet you were seen in Rovinj
ten days ago with the murdered man in his café.

143
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,780
Why are you talking nonsense?
I haven't been to Rovinj,

144
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,680
I haven't seen Ivan,
and now if you please,

145
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,380
either let me go,
or let me call my lawyer.

146
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,980
Call your lawyer.

147
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,680
No connection.
- This is a protected building of the Ministry of Interior.

148
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Alright, let me make a call
from the landline.

149
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,280
Visitors are not allowed
to use the official phone.

150
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,180
In that case... goodbye.

151
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,680
Inspector Mirko Sandić.
- What do you want from me?

152
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,480
I want you to sit.
- I won't sit, I want to leave!

153
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,980
Uroš... sit.

154
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,480
Are we on a first-name basis?

155
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
Now we're best friends.

156
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,880
You see... Dukić and I
bet on something.

157
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,380
Maybe you can help us?

158
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,180
She thinks somehow you're involved
in the murder of Ivan Bilić.

159
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,980
And I think you're not
capable of that.

160
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,680
Tell us, who's right?

161
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,880
You.
- Who?

162
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,380
You're right.

163
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,880
I was in Rovinj 7 days ago
and met Ivan.

164
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,980
But in no way
am I involved in his murder.

165
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,780
What were you doing there?

166
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,380
There's a woman there,

167
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,580
who's married.

168
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,380
There you go!

169
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,980
I suppose your wife
is not aware?

170
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,180
Of course she's not aware.
- And you don't want her to find out?

171
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,080
In that case, tell us everything
about your meeting with Ivan.

172
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,880
There's not much to tell.
I told my wife I was leaving...

173
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,980
At work.

174
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,480
Actually, I went to Rovin.
And there...

175
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,380
I accidentally met Ivan.
- Yes, and?

176
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,580
And I was glad we saw each other.

177
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,280
Due to circumstances.
- Yes.

178
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,480
And that's it, I think.
Nothing...

179
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,980
We had coffee, and that's it. I'm not...
- Excuse me, Mr. Perich,

180
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,180
where did you stay while in Rovin?

181
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,180
I think that goes without saying.

182
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,880
You don't want to tell us who she is?
- Please don't.

183
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,480
I understand.

184
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Okay. Now we've clarified some things.

185
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,480
Can I leave?
- If you ask me, yes.

186
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,780
Mr. Perich, can I
ask for a little more help?

187
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,080
If you'd be so kind
as to provide a DNA sample for analysis.

188
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,280
Why?
- It's just a formality.

189
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,280
We just want to exclude you
as a suspect

190
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,780
in the murder of Ivan Bilich. You know,
the Croatian police insist on that.

191
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,980
This is an order
from the Croatian prosecutor.

192
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,180
I want a lawyer immediately!

193
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,880
In that case, we'll detain you
for 72 hours and report you

194
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,880
to the chief prosecutor.
- What will you report me for?

195
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,380
Complicity in the murder
of Ivan Bilich.

196
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,780
What murder?
What murder, damn it?

197
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,480
I have nothing to do with these murders!

198
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,680
In that case, give us a sample
and you're free.

199
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,580
Can I leave now?
- Of course, go ahead.

200
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,180
Unlike Inspector Kocic,
I am completely sure

201
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,780
that you are capable of such a thing.

202
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,180
Female intuition, I suppose?

203
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,180
Many murderers are family people.
- Goodbye.

204
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Hello?

205
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,380
Why did you call me?

206
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,980
Do you remember the one who comes to you?

207
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,780
The one from the video clip?
This crazy one, this...

208
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,380
The one who harasses people?

209
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,580
What do you have to do with him?

210
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,780
Well, I work for him.

211
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,980
What do you work?

212
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,580
See, your father has really stepped on the line.

213
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,780
Where is he going?
- Let me go!

214
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,280
They'll fuck us up,
if they see us together, clear?

215
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,080
I don't care! Let me go!
- Hey, hey, hey!

216
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,180
Hey!

217
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,180
<b>VILLAGE IN KOSOVO</b>

218
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,980
Open up!

219
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,380
Does it hurt?

220
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,780
How about now?

221
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,280
Okay.
Shall we try something else?

222
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,980
Try saying... Driton.

223
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,680
Driton.

224
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,080
Okay.
Try saying...

225
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,260
Rruga (street).

226
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Rru-ga.

227
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,960
Okay. Let's try
to say nona (mother).

228
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,860
No-na.

229
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,060
Come on, once more.

230
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,660
Just once more, come on.

231
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,960
No-na.

232
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,260
Everything's fine.

233
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,860
It's not good.

234
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,660
The wound is healing well,
but the tongue is damaged.

235
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,460
And I'm afraid he won't be able
to speak anymore.

236
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,060
Never?

237
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,660
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
but I want to be honest.

238
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,060
The bullet has taken off
a large part of his tongue.

239
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,760
Thank you.

240
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,160
Madam.

241
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,860
Did Agim know
that Driton would be in the car?

242
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
I don't think so.

243
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,860
If he knew, he wouldn't have ordered
to shoot the child.

244
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,460
But Hashim saw him.

245
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,360
He saw him.
- The bloodsucker will get him!

246
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,760
Don't do that, he's your brother.

247
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,260
This is between me and Agim.

248
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:59,660
You and the children shouldn't become
victims of our feud.

249
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,860
Listen!

250
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,260
Take the children and get out of here.

251
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,560
Go to a safe place.

252
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,060
I'll take care of it.

253
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,660
Hello?

254
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,160
Okay.

255
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,460
I'm coming.
- What's happening?

256
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,060
I have to go to Kosovo.
Come on, drive.

257
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,060
Take the keys.
My car is at Gazela.

258
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,060
Come on, let's go.

259
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,460
Did your friend tell you
he's coming home?

260
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,960
Which friend?
- Who do you think?

261
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Mima.
- What, did Mima come home?

262
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
Yes.
- Why didn't he tell me?

263
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,960
Well, now I'm telling you.

264
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,160
And?
- Nothing. He's asking what you told me.

265
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,360
And?
- Well, I didn't tell him anything!

266
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,560
He doesn't know anything.

267
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,760
What happened at the police?

268
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,160
They took a DNA sample for analysis.

269
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,660
Why?
- They know I've been to Rovin.

270
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,560
I lied to them that I have a lover there.

271
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
And now what?

272
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,960
I don't know what now.

273
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,760
Come on.
- Come on.

274
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,660
Call me.
- Everything will be fine.

275
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,460
Goodbye.
- Well, goodbye.

276
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,260
What have you been doing at home today?

277
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,760
Huh?
- What did I sing?

278
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,260
Listen, you psychopath! If you come home
again, I'll kill you!

279
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,760
What did he sing, huh?
- If I had sung, I wouldn't be here!

280
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,960
They know I've been to Rovin and
they took a DNA sample from me.

281
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,260
Damn you!

282
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,460
How will I travel?

283
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,660
This is Rize.

284
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,860
Hey, hey!
The phone.

285
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,360
Damn you...

286
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,260
When I tell you to be quiet,
is it clear!

287
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,260
Don't shout! Don't shout!

288
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,160
Help!

289
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,760
Help! No!
- Hold her! Hold her hands!

290
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,160
Wait, wait!

291
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,180
Don't shout!
Hello, hey!

292
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,680
Shut up, mom!

293
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,880
Hello there!

294
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,680
I can't see! I can't see!

295
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,580
Move your hand!

296
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,080
You motherf***er! I'll blow you up!

297
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,480
I'll tear you apart!
Come on, bring it on!

298
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,280
This is going on the internet
if I see you with Luka again!

299
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,880
And don't call again!

300
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,380
Get him inside.

301
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,980
Good night, sweetheart!

302
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,620
Hey! How are you?
What's up?

303
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,120
Can I come in?

304
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,720
What?
I might be paranoid,

305
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,720
but the results from Lyon arrived.

And what do they say?

306
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,920
All the samples match
the one we took from Uroš Perić.

307
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,120
Just give me a minute.

308
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,220
Go call your sister, please.

309
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,120
Let's eat.

310
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,020
Are you feeling okay?

311
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,720
See you...
What?

312
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,220
Tell mom I'm still asleep.

313
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,820
Still asleep.

314
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,820
Una?

315
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,020
Police!

316
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,520
Don't run!

317
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Get inside! Inside!

318
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,920
See you!
Check upstairs!

319
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,220
Where is my daughter?

320
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,720
Lie down!

321
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,020
Stay with the little one!

322
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,120
Good day, Mr. Petrović.
Mrs. Perić.

323
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,020
Inspector Koçi, the way
you arrested my client is unacceptable.

324
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,620
Are we going to discuss
police powers, or will we get to the point?

325
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,220
I'm listening.
Interrogation of Maria Perić, related to the criminal case

326
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,320
in which her husband, Uroš Perić,
is a suspect.

327
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,720
The interrogation will be conducted by Inspector Petrit Koçi
and Divna Dukić from Interpol,

328
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,220
in the presence of
lawyer Pavel Petrović.

329
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,120
Mrs. Perić, do you know
where your husband is right now?

330
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,720
I don't know, I already told you.
When did you last see him?

331
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,120
Yesterday morning.
And didn't he tell you where he was going?

332
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,420
He didn't tell me, no. We haven't been
talking much in the last two months.

333
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,320
So, no.
Since the incident?

334
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Exactly, yes.

335
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,420
Look... it's hard for me
to believe this.

336
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,120
Look... I don't care
if you believe me or not.

337
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,620
Say whatever you have to say,
arrest me or let me go!

338
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,020
Maria...
Don't mess with me, Pavel! Let me go!

339
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,620
Will you tell me why
my client was arrested,

340
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,020
what evidence you have against her?
Of course, we arrested her

341
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,620
because we suspect she was
an accomplice to her husband, Uroš Perić,

342
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,220
in several serious criminal
offenses.

343
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,620
Including murders,
infliction of serious bodily harm,

344
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,520
illegal possession of weapons,
and intentional

345
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,220
misleading
investigating authorities.

346
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,820
Murders? Uroš?
In a span of a few months,

347
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,620
several murders happened
related to Dardan Berisha.

348
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,520
Your client's husband is involved.

349
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,720
DNA analysis shows he's been
at all the crime scenes.

350
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,820
Inspector Kocic,
you know very well

351
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,220
that DNA analysis alone
is not sufficient evidence.

352
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,620
It's sufficient
to issue an Interpol Red Notice for Uros.

353
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,220
I've known your client's husband
for over 30 years.

354
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,920
I'm completely sure
he's not capable of...

355
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,520
Mr. Petrovic, thank you
for your personal opinion, but please,

356
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,620
let your client tell us
what her husband is capable of!

357
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,120
You invaded my house.
You arrested me,

358
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,520
and now you're telling me my husband
is a mass murderer? Are you normal?

359
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,920
Maria...

360
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,420
Mrs. Peric...
- What?!

361
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,620
Mrs. Peric,

362
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,620
once we catch Uros, he'll never
get out again.

363
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,820
And pray to God it happens.
Because the criminals

364
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,120
he kills for will eliminate him
at the first opportunity.

365
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,320
You have two options. Either end up
in jail with your husband

366
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,920
and risk your children's lives,

367
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,520
or help us find Uros.

368
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,220
In that case, I promise you,
we'll do everything we can

369
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,220
to get you into the
witness protection program.

370
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,920
Show the pictures, please.

371
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,120
Ulcin.

372
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Belgrade.

373
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Belgrade.

374
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,920
Rovin.

375
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,120
Can you leave us alone
for a few minutes?

376
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Of course.

377
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,200
Maria...
- What?

378
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,800
If you know anything about this,
now's the time to tell me.

379
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,800
I don't know anything. How would I know?

380
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,400
What could I know about it?

381
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,700
Okay.

382
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,500
Whatever happens, I'll get you out.

383
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,700
What have you decided?

384
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,200
My client wants to state that
she has no connection to the events

385
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,600
you mentioned. And that she has
no information about her husband.

386
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,800
Alright.
- Alright.

387
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,300
In that case, can we go?
- You can.

388
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,900
The lady will stay here overnight.
- Why?

389
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,900
- Just taking advantage of the law.

390
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,800
What are you doing? Completely...
- Okay, Pavle...

391
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,300
Why are you doing this?
- Pavle, there's no problem. Okay.

392
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,800
Everything's fine.

393
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,800
And the children? Should I call Bozo?

394
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,300
Don't call Bozo, please.
Can you stay with them tonight?

395
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,700
No problem.
- Thank you, Pavle.

396
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,300
Don't mention it.

397
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,500
<i>Last calls:
Luka</i>
