1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,320
Previously

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,820
Are we not having breakfast today? Maid Maria is taking care of it.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,320
Did someone pay? Nothing, boss.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,340
Disaster. It would be.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,640
If it weren't for the order to Montenegro.

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,320
They lifted him in the air. Witness's safety,

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,120
was your responsibility. Yours were the shippers.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,020
He wants to transport the goods to Italy.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,020
I told him: "Don't do anything stupid, don't mess with Dardan."

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,820
If you mention that name again, I'll kill you, got it?

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,020
Berisha controls 30% of the heroin trade.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,220
He is linked to extortion, human trafficking, and murder.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,420
Furthermore, we have given Bessa.

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,620
Are you going to transport heroin?

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,720
Now your friend will prepare you a nice dose.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,320
I have to drive to Montenegro instead of Jole tonight.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,220
Tonight.

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,520
They accepted me.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,920
Dushitsa, my darling, may luck be with you! To Mom's heart!

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,920
Now Dad can't forbid me to study in America.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,920
Come on, you can go faster!

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,320
Go, Bes!

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,820
Bes, slow down! I'm going to fuck off!

24
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,760
Mr. Berisha? Wait.

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,160
Accept my sincerest condolences.

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,260
Who was driving the other car? Some guy from Belgrade.

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,360
Is he alive? Where is he?

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,660
I asked you something!

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,860
He's here, at the hospital.

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,060
Dardan!

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,460
Where did you go?

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,360
Don't do anything blinded by grief. Now you have to be with your family.

33
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,980
Be strong! I'm with you.

34
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,000
<b>Translated by AcePhil</b>

35
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,280
Dinner is ready.

36
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,780
Driton, Bashkim. Come on, children!

37
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,280
Come on. Go to your rooms. Come on.

Episode 2 SUFFERING

40
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,640
Hello, sweetheart? Hello, love.

41
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
We're heading to the airport now.

42
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,640
We'll be there in two hours. How are you? I killed the girl, damn it!

43
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,240
Can you hear me? Here.

44
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,640
We're leaving now. Come on.

45
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,040
Come on, we'll see each other soon.

46
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,340
From Divna: " Dardan's daughter died."

47
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,740
"We're leaving for Belgrade immediately."

48
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,740
How are you holding up?

49
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,840
You have to be wise and restrained.

50
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,740
Don't do anything that would endanger us.

51
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,740
That dog Petrit is just waiting for that.

52
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,840
No one wants a partner who can't be controlled.

53
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,640
We'll talk about it after I bury my daughter, uncle.

54
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,940
Dardan!

55
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,810
Look at me. I can't.

56
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,000
Are we clear?

57
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,800
Have I ever deceived you?

58
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,940
Excuse me, but... here.

59
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
This is him.

60
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,640
Excuse me, please. My husband has had an incident. Uros Peric.

61
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,820
Follow me. Here he is.

62
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,220
You can't! Why?

63
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Let me go! I have an order.

64
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Please!

65
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,020
My love! Hey!

66
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,220
We gave him strong sedatives, and he'll probably sleep for a few hours.

67
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
My love!

68
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,720
That there is my best friend.

69
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Do you know who Dardan Berisha is?

70
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,720
Belgrade

71
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,120
Divna, two emergency tickets for me and for Mirko to Montenegro.

72
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,320
And see what you can find out. Should I call Lekich?

73
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,840
Of course. This is my chance. Hello?

74
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,040
Hello, sweetheart. I'm not there. I'm landing now...

75
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,240
I know. Okay, darling, see. Don't worry,

76
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,740
Dad is a bit busy, don't get nervous, wait for him.

77
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,240
I can call you later. I'll call you soon. Bye.

78
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,240
My love. Hey.

79
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,440
What's up?

80
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
Damn it, I killed the child!

81
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,640
Come talk to the kids a bit, huh? What do you say? Come on.

82
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,640
Come out in front of me. He was probably driving at 100 km/h.

83
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,140
Hey, sweetheart. Come talk to Dad for a bit?

84
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,340
Come.

85
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,280
Hello, sweetie? Hi Dad, are you alive?

86
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
I'm alive. What are you doing? Everything is great, here...

87
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,180
We're getting ready for school.

88
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,780
How are you? Excellent.

89
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,980
I'm a bit... I'm a bit shaken.

90
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,280
I'm fine. Good.

91
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Una? Yes?

92
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,480
I love you, sweetheart. I love you too.

93
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,580
What's up? We have a problem.

94
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,680
Montenegro Police Ulcin Police Department

95
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,480
Where are you, Lamia? How long do you plan to fool me?

96
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,680
Lamia, the experienced stallion is the best!

97
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,680
Oh, boss! Do you want coffee, brandy... What's happening with the crash?

98
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,580
Besianna Berisha crashed into the bus of some unfortunate person from Belgrade.

99
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,780
It's all her fault. And the Englishman? What was Dardan's daughter doing with him?

100
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,380
I wonder about that too. Tell Divna to call London and check on him.

101
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,980
And those four on the beach? Why didn't I receive the report?

102
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,980
Ah, it's not ready yet. We'll send it tomorrow.

103
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,280
We identified two of them.

104
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,680
Isa Sadriu and Ekrem Alic.

105
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,980
Cigarette smugglers.

106
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,680
Sadriu died of a heroin overdose.

107
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,580
And the little one shot himself in the heart, right?

108
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,280
We all know whose doing this is.

109
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,280
That's why would he kill some cigarette smugglers?

110
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,180
Try to find out. Should I ask Dardan?

111
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,480
What about putting pressure on his people? Afrim or Hashim?

112
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,180
On what grounds? You don't need grounds.

113
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,880
Call them for an informative conversation. And they'll respond?

114
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,280
If they don't respond, arrest them.

115
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,780
When is the funeral of Dardan's daughter?

116
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Tomorrow. After the funeral,

117
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,180
bring in Hashim.

118
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,280
Pick up. I apologize.

119
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
Hello?

120
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
You need to work on your form.

121
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,680
And you don't need to be too arrogant, because Petrit wants to lock you up.

122
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,880
Who cares?

123
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,780
The boss wants an autopsy on Besiana.

124
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
And your traditions?

125
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,180
What do you care about our traditions?

126
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,180
The blood analysis is already done. Only for alcohol.

127
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,580
But the boss wants a full one.

128
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,980
Drugs, pills...

129
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,080
A full analysis. You know...

130
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,480
My dear, it will come out.

131
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,880
Fine, I'll try to get an order.

132
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,080
What order, idiot?

133
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,680
It has to be unofficial.

134
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,160
And you'll only tell the boss the result.

135
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,060
Hashim, only an idiot would ask that of me.

136
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,860
I am a member of the special unit of Interpol fighting against narcotics.

137
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,570
You're a member of the Special Squad at my job!

138
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,760
Mr. Perich, I apologize, but it's really necessary.

139
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,760
Oh, mate...

140
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,160
I wanted to say that my client is not a criminal.

141
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,640
Never convicted... You're right.

142
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,020
The problem is, he killed another participant in the incident.

143
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,390
And according to the law of the Republic of Montenegro,

144
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,950
we have to detain him for 48 hours.

145
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,700
I understand, but if you let us go to Belgrade, I guarantee you,

146
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,160
he will be available... Colleague!

147
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,920
If we let Mr. Perich go to Belgrade,

148
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,590
what do you think Dardan Berisha will do?

149
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,560
LAKE GENEVA

150
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,930
My condolences, Dardan. Be strong.

151
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,180
Thank you, Agime. God bless you.

152
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,380
I have no words. I'm in shock.

153
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,860
How is my sister? You can imagine.

154
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,780
Let me hear her. She doesn't answer my calls.

155
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:46,060
She's asleep. Good.

156
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,800
How are the boys? How do you think, Agime?

157
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,800
Yes, I can imagine. I have to go.

158
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,660
We'll try to come with Ilir as soon as possible.

159
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,560
Thank you, see you soon.

160
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,450
Yes, Dad? Call that moron.

161
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,250
Dad, sorry, but maybe now is not the time.

162
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,550
On the contrary, now is possibly the best time.

163
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,750
They know how to pay assassins, and we know the media.

164
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,980
Don't you want their killers to come here to us, Ilir?

165
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,270
I don't want that. Come on, son.

166
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,780
Okay. Fine, fine. No problem. Bye.

167
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,680
It was Divna, about the Englishman.

168
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,080
Just some nonsense on Ibiza with ecstasy and minors.

169
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,380
Nothing for us. We'll see.

170
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,880
After the Englishman, we'll visit the bus driver.

171
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,680
Tell management that we'll go after the funeral.

172
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Right away. Let's go.

173
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,480
Inspector Petrit Koçi. Mirko Sandić. Interpol.

174
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,180
Was Besiana Berisha your girlfriend?

175
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,380
What? No!

176
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,580
We just went out together. Since when?

177
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,780
I don't know. A few weeks.

178
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,720
Did you know who her father was?

179
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,420
I know he's loaded. Is that why you liked her?

180
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,420
Damn you!

181
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,980
Besiana's father is Dardan Berisha.

182
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,720
The biggest drug trafficker in Southeast Europe.

183
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,690
Did she tell you about him? Have you ever seen him?

184
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,190
Him or any of his people? Look...

185
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,860
I had a gig on Ibiza. It got postponed, so I came here.

186
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,520
Bes was secretive. How was I supposed to know her dad was a gangster?

187
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,320
Was Besiana Berisha under the influence of drugs or alcohol?

188
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
I won't say anything more without her lawyer.

189
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Why are you so hostile, Mr. Bay?

190
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,920
Think about what happened. And about all parties involved.

191
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,220
And then think about who would be on your side.

192
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Yes?

193
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,420
The headline is "The Cancer of the Balkans." Dad wants you to leave for there right away.

194
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,900
Okay, I got it...

195
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,980
Look, I'm all about this...

196
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,360
See, the daughter is not the issue. The issue is the "cream" of the business,

197
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,960
which will be at the funeral. Okay.

198
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,270
Bye.

199
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,950
Don't worry about anything.

200
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,550
Good evening, Mr. Perich.

201
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,740
Inspector Petrit Koçi and Mirko Sandić from Interpol.

202
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,740
Mr. Perich? Are you sure the accident was an unfortunate incident?

203
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,540
What do you mean? It seems unusual to me

204
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,120
that you didn't notice the car on this straight and clean road.

205
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,420
I noticed the car. But I thought it would stop.

206
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,040
Did you kill the daughter of the biggest drug lord in the Balkans accidentally?

207
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,540
What do you mean? That I hit her on purpose?

208
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,260
Uroš, you are in great danger.

209
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,160
Especially if the car accident wasn't a coincidence.

210
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,760
When Dardan Berisha decided to retaliate,

211
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,960
Interpol might be your only chance.

212
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,260
And what does Interpol have to do with an accident?

213
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,960
With an accident - nothing.

214
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,620
KOSOVO MOUNTAIN RANGE

215
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,480
Mr. Braha...

216
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Congratulations on your appointment!

217
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,220
Mr. Berisha sends you his congratulations.

218
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,460
Now that you are at the helm of the Kosovo Privatization Agency,

219
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,060
we will listen carefully to every word you say.

220
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,120
Mr. Berisha finds your conditions acceptable.

221
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,890
And he sends you a small gift. A vision for the future.

222
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,990
The future construction is in the national park. That's right.

223
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,750
You have too many national parks.

224
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,350
We will declassify this beauty and start building your

225
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,620
"Balkan Side of Wonders." Although, as you know,

226
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,120
I am obliged to invite more candidates. You might have competition.

227
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,280
As you know, Mr. Berisha can be very persuasive.

228
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,080
When will the auction start?

229
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,880
Together with our Serbian colleagues, we are trying to find

230
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,440
common ground to achieve our joint venture.

231
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,540
The agreed amount was transferred to your account this morning.

232
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,540
And you and your Serbian colleagues use the same bank.

233
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Mr. Braha...

234
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,460
Uroš Perić. Born in Belgrade. 44 years old.

235
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,180
No criminal record. Married. Has two children.

236
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,280
Father - Božidar Perić, retired.

237
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,480
He owns a pharmaceutical transport company, "Pharma Trans."

238
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,680
The company has loans.

239
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Is that all?

240
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,480
There's something else.

241
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,080
His brother was killed in '94 during the conflicts in Zemun.

242
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
It begins.

243
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,980
Hashim. Agim.

244
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,820
Where is your boss? He's waiting for you upstairs.

245
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,520
Accept my condolences.

246
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,980
Be strong!

247
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,960
Accept my condolences.

248
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Thank you.

249
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Accept my condolences.

250
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Thank you.

251
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,460
Be strong! Hang in there!

252
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,260
What a tragedy... I can't believe it.

253
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,660
It's hard when we lose a pure and innocent soul...

254
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,520
And on the other hand, those who don't deserve it continue to live.

255
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,160
Such a shame!

256
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,360
A sin!

257
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,160
A sin...

258
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,300
It's true.

259
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,900
Where is my sister? I would like to see her.

260
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,440
Agim...

261
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,120
Hey. Hey, don't worry.

262
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Everything will be fine. Come on. I'm here.

263
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,420
Did you kill Dardan Berisha's daughter?

264
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,220
Which god sent you?

265
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,940
Your hand is gilded.

266
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,840
The father is a devil, and the mother suffers.

267
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,440
Dardan Berisha...

268
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,380
The shame of the Albanians!

269
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,030
I'm here because of him.

270
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,430
Do you know what Besa is?

271
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,360
I gave Besa to my Serbian neighbor

272
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,060
to protect his house in the city, because of the war.

273
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,760
And I kept it. A relative of Dardan wanted to take the house.

274
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,060
He told me, "Don't, don't"!

275
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,660
I killed him like a dog!

276
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,160
But that man can never return home, can he?

277
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,760
But that's not important, son.

278
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,060
The important thing is that I gave Besa.

279
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,460
That's what matters!

280
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,260
Come on, grandpa, get out.

281
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,360
You can't hide from Dardan.

282
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,960
And even at the end of the world, he will find you!

283
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,360
Both you and your family!

284
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,260
Mrs. Berisha, my condolences for your daughter.

285
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,360
Stop. He came to provoke us.

286
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,060
Do you know that I'm a foreign reporter?

287
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,960
Okay, okay!

288
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,260
This is too much! We will talk to the authorities!

289
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,760
God, accept her soul into heaven!

290
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,160
You're not normal! And what did he say?

291
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,360
That I love him.

292
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,460
Witty. And what was that with the shirt?

293
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,760
When someone from the family throws a shirt into the grave,

294
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,360
it means that the deceased will be avenged.

295
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,660
And why the lad? He's angry because he's a lad.

296
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,260
You know why.

297
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,460
And this is because you're brave and strong,

298
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,560
but never do anything on your own again!

299
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,060
Understood? Now go.

300
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,360
Speak!

301
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,960
I have the autopsy report.

302
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,960
Find the dealer!

303
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,660
Call Braha and tell him to release the driver.

304
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,060
Consider it done.

305
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,260
You get five, you get ten.

306
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,060
Afrim, my brother, you scared me.

307
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,160
Drive!

308
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,360
From Belgrade? Let's go.

309
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,660
Give me that. Here you go.

310
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
We sleep and we trade.

311
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,760
Isn't it suspicious that they released me so quickly?

312
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,160
No. It's not unusual. They can only hold you for 48 hours.

313
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Let's have a beer. Let's.

314
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,260
You tell him. He'll listen to you. I have no problem with that.

315
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,860
I got my man back. I want to treat you.

316
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,460
You guys have a beer, I'm going for a swim.

317
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,820
Excuse me... Mr. Perich?

318
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
Good day.

319
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,180
Who are you?

320
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,660
Angelo Dini. Nice to meet you.

321
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,460
I'm from the press. Journalist.

322
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,560
For many Italian media. Just a little chat, if you may...

323
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,560
If you'd be so kind. I write about the tragedy,

324
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,960
that befell the most controversial businessman in this region...

325
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,820
And who are you? His lawyer.

326
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,320
Great. So the two of us will...

327
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,020
Okay, okay. Don't worry. I understand.

328
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,950
I don't want any trouble. Explain to the lady.

329
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,360
Okay. Sorry. Thank you.

330
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,460
I'll try to get some sleep.

331
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,260
The boss is looking for you.

332
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,560
I don't know why he's sleeping so much!

333
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,060
Leave him. Come on.

334
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,060
Cheers!

335
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,960
I'm going to wake him up.

336
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,760
Urose?

337
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,360
Milichak?

338
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,660
Urose!

339
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,060
Pavle! Urose is gone!

340
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,970
Are you the one who killed Besiana?

341
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,970
How is that murder? I didn't kill her!

342
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,660
It was an accident! I don't believe in accidents.

343
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,800
Someone has to pay! You, the driver who killed her,

344
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,800
or you, the dealer whose drugs ruined my daughter.

345
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,160
Boss, forgive me! I didn't know. I sold it to an Englishman, boss!

346
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,600
If I knew, I would have killed him like a dog, boss!

347
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,300
Boss! What should I do with you two?

348
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,700
Should I accidentally kill you?

349
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,500
Boro? Let him do something for me.

350
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,500
Kill the driver with your bare hands! No!

351
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,300
No, no, don't! I'm not guilty!

352
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
Hey! I'm not guilty!

353
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,800
Hey! I'm not guilty! I'm not...

354
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,200
Release him!

355
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,200
