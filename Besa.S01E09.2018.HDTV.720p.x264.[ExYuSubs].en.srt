<i>Previously</i>

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,380
<i>Father, where are you going?
To the cemetery.</i>

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,580
<i>Can I come too?
Come.</i>

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,180
<i>He's in the operating room.
Fortunately, he was wearing a bulletproof vest.</i>

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,380
<i>Who did it?
I don't know.</i>

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,780
<i>Who would shoot a child?</i>

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,380
<i>The bullet severed Driton's tongue.</i>

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,980
<i>Why do you keep lying to me?
Where were you?</i>

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,780
<i>Do you think we don't see
how you're falling apart?</i>

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,880
<i>I'm sorry.
Dad, you need to pull yourself together.</i>

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,580
<i>Go ahead.
What do you want to hear?</i>

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,980
<i>The whole story.</i>

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,580
<i>We will block the entrances.</i>

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,980
<i>No one should dare to enter!</i>

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,780
<i>The situation is serious.
According to our information,</i>

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,080
<i>there are at least
15 armed individuals inside.</i>

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,680
<i>It's been a long time since we've seen each other.</i>

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
<i>Very long.</i>

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,380
<i>It was Bayram when you killed my father.</i>

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,280
<i>Our sources report
that Dardan Berisha has died,</i>

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,180
<i>but we still don't have definitive confirmation.</i>

22
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,880
<i>Where are you, Mima?</i>

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,280
<i>Huh? I heard you're unemployed now?</i>

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,780
<i>What are you playing at?</i>

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,480
Come on, kids, greet your father!
Show some manners.

26
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,080
Hello, Dad!
Hello, Dad!

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,880
Hello, children.

28
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,180
Let's go to the yard,
let's talk.

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,580
See how well-mannered Mima is?

30
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,580
When he comes as a guest,
he brings gifts.

31
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,780
<i>Hired killer</i>

32
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,380
Show your father how you kill them.
Go.

33
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,580
And you, show your plush toy. Go!

34
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,780
Come here.

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,580
And I have bad news for you.

36
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,080
Our mutual friend
has crossed the line.

37
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,680
Which is good news for me.

38
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,980
Let's go to the yard with you.

39
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,580
Let's have a talk.

40
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,980
Maybe, if you ask me nicely.

41
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,480
Please.

42
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,480
Please.

43
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,980
See, children, how
a kind word opens iron gates.

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,180
I say I am an iron gate, you understand?

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,880
Where are you?

46
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,080
For the last time, I'm dealing with you!
Understood?

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Understood!

48
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,480
When I call - you answer!
You come where I say!

49
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Is that clear?
Clear!

50
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,880
Hug Mima and say goodbye!

51
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
Good day.

55
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,980
Why are you silent?

56
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,580
Isn't there someone to report
this maniac to the police?

57
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,580
Who is this guy?

58
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,480
Do you hear me? What am I asking you?
Who is this guy?

59
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,080
He's...
A man I owe money to.

60
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,280
Is there anyone in this world
you don't owe money to?

61
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,380
How can you let such a guy
break into your home and harass the children?

62
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,880
Are you normal?
I'll call the police!

63
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,480
Don't provoke him, Maria!
Both of you are insane!

64
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,980
I can't believe
what you've gotten us into!

65
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,380
I'm going to sleep at my father's.

66
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm sorry.

67
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,580
I didn't come to bother you.

68
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,180
Please, just see something.
Come in.

69
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,180
Who is this guy?
When I call, you answer!

70
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,380
Clear?  Sure!

71
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,880
I don't know.

72
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,580
Luca, do you know this guy?

73
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm going to see how Driton is.

74
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,080
Driton?

75
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,980
He's wounded, but he's alive.

76
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,880
Were they police?

77
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,380
I don't know...
They were... in uniforms.

78
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,380
I'm going to get the doctor.
Don't.

79
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
Why?

80
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,480
Don't tell anyone...
Not even Teuta.

81
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,780
Why?

82
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,380
Why?

83
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,580
He's involved...
Someone from our side.

84
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,980
Someone from our side.

85
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,680
Why do you think so?

86
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,080
I sense it. You need
to take me to Kosovo. Quickly.

87
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,780
Your uncle will get you out.
Don't worry...

88
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,980
He's asleep now.

89
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,080
Rest...

90
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,580
Let her go to her room.

91
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,080
Come on, go.

92
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,580
I've done my part.

93
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,580
It's time for you to gather your people

94
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,080
and leave.

95
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,280
Agim sends his regards.

96
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,980
Thank you.

97
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,180
He instructed you personally
to finish the job.

98
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,780
The hospital is full of his people,

99
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,180
just let me try something
and they'll kill me on the spot.

100
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,680
Now you're in charge.

101
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,280
Make sure we're alone.

102
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,780
I'm not in charge, Skender is.

103
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,980
Hashim...

104
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,880
I didn't come here to explain myself to you.

105
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,980
The boss said what he wants.
It has to happen tomorrow.

106
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,680
And my wife?

107
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
And the child?

108
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,080
We'll take care of them.

109
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,780
Until you finish the job.

110
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,580
What if I die?

111
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,980
Agim gave Besa
to take care of them.

112
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Miss Fisher!

113
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Good evening.

114
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,180
Excuse me, I didn't mean to frighten you.

115
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,580
Mister... Sokoli, I presume.

116
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,480
Exactly.
What do you want?

117
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,280
You probably know
what happened to Mr. Berisha.

118
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,280
If he, God forbid,
doesn't recover,

119
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,880
I think you'll need
a serious partner.

120
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,180
The privatization of Brezovica
is a big deal.

121
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,980
And this new partner...
it's you, I suppose?

122
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,980
I just wanted to show
my enthusiasm, that's all.

123
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,480
Think about my proposal.
I will think about it.

124
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,980
I'll find a way to contact you.
Please, don't hesitate.

125
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,680
This is my nephew's number
in Bosevo.

126
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,180
He's keeping our money.

127
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,980
I've booked a hotel,
everything is arranged.

128
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,580
We'll see each other in a few days.

129
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,380
It's time.

130
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,680
I have to go.

131
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,480
Two shots in Agani.

132
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,180
The killer seems to have escaped
through the window,

133
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,780
we found shoeprints.

134
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,280
Then he went to the sea,
where his accomplice was waiting.

135
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,780
Alright, we'll get back to that later.
Who found the body?

136
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,480
Agani's future wife.
Did you get her statements?

137
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,280
Of course, but she didn't tell us
anything useful.

138
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,380
She didn't see anything,
except the dead body.

139
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,580
And Agani's bodyguards?

140
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,180
We questioned them too, of course.

141
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,480
They didn't see anything.
They didn't see the faces,

142
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,580
but they saw two men in a boat
and shot at them.

143
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,280
We're done here.

144
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Here, here. These bullet traces...

145
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,980
They were made by Agani's people,
shooting from there.

146
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,480
We found blood here, but...

147
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,580
we determined it's not from the accomplice
in the murder.

148
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,680
Alright. Didn't you... send it
to the laboratory?

149
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,080
Yes, of course. We sent everything.

150
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,980
The killed accomplice is Ivan Bilic.

151
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,480
Local tavern owner and drunkard.

152
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,680
So, Ivan stayed
in the boat,

153
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,080
the killer escaped through the stairs...
And here the traces are lost.

154
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,780
Open from the back!
Hello, hello!

155
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,480
This is the food. People in the hospital
are hungry, let him pass!

156
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,880
How is the boss?
Still sleeping.

157
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,380
But the doctor said he's fine.
Excellent.

158
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,980
Go, get some rest.
Now it's my turn.

159
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,480
We'll see you tonight.

160
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,480
Forgive me...

161
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,280
Be silent!

162
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,280
Nothing has changed
since the last time I was here.

163
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,880
From your smile, I can tell
it was romantic.

164
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,980
I'm not smiling at all, colleague.
Continue.

165
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,380
Ah, yes. That's why we're here. The owner
of the café, the late Ivan Bilic,

166
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,180
was a citizen
of the Republic of Croatia, but...

167
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,980
But?
But his childhood and youth,

168
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,580
he spent in Belgrade.
And why is that important?

169
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,280
It's important because...
Ana! Come, please.

170
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,980
Ana, tell your colleague
what you told me.

171
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,980
He was around 40 years old, judging
by the accent, a Serb from Belgrade.

172
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,580
Recently, more and more of them
are coming from there.

173
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,760
Handsome, tall.
Wore a denim jacket...

174
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,660
And I think he knew Ivan.

175
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,360
I heard this person
calling him some nickname.

176
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,960
What did he call him?
- Ivaylo-Pimpek.

177
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,860
Did you hear how
the other person was called?

178
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,160
Well, something like...
I didn't hear very clearly...

179
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,560
Something like... Tuki.
- What?

180
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,360
Tuki. At least that's what I heard.

181
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,460
Tuki. And that's like Pimpek, right?
- Yes, yes.

182
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,260
Yes, people from Belgrade have many nicknames.

183
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,960
Okay, and?
- Nothing,

184
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,860
I mean, I didn't hear...
the whole conversation, I was busy...

185
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,060
I heard something about the gymnasium.
- Where?

186
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,360
Well, in Belgrade. Ivan spent
his childhood there.

187
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,560
Alright, thank you Ana.
That's all, you're free.

188
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,460
Finally, we have a real
detective task, Inspector.

189
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,660
Let's find out which Serbian male name
rhymes with...

190
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,160
Thank you, colleague. Let's leave
the rhyming for another time, shall we?

191
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,160
Ah, yes... Yes.

192
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,660
Please provide me with all the information
about Ivan Bilic as soon as possible

193
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,660
and urgently send the samples for analysis.

194
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,760
And will you have time for dinner?

195
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,360
Colleague, I am a high-ranking officer!

196
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,660
I didn't hear you tonight.

197
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,360
I have to go.

198
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,360
A major's omelette is not to be refused!

199
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,060
Speak.

200
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,260
Where did he go?

201
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,760
Home?

202
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,760
Thank you for your hospitality.

203
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,460
Wait!

204
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,360
You know, I didn't
treat your mother well.

205
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,360
I know. I was there too.

206
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,960
I know you were.

207
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,760
That's why I'm talking to you.

208
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,060
Don't...
become like me.

209
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,960
I can't mess up like you.

210
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,660
I love all my relatives.

211
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Dad, I really can't
play "Broken Telephone"!

212
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Fine.

213
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,160
I don't know. I'll give it to you if she wants it.

214
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,060
It's dad.
- What?

215
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,760
I can't talk now.
Come on, bye!

216
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Why?

217
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Why?

218
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,160
Who shoots at children?
Who?

219
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,160
Who shoots at children?
Huh?

220
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,660
Who? Who shoots at children?
Traitor!

221
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Enough!
- Damn it!

222
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,060
Do you see those news reporters?
Break their cameras!

223
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,260
I'm listening!

224
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,360
Listening?
- The deadline I gave them,

225
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,760
expires in six hours.
But I won't comply.

226
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,960
I need your agreement.
- To shoot? To start a war?

227
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,660
With all the civilians
we have in the hospital?

228
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,180
Maybe you're not thinking straight, Kochi!
- Kochi.

229
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,980
Kochi...
- The alternative is to let

230
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,080
Dardan Berisha do
whatever he wants in Montenegro.

231
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,180
The man on his deathbed?
- 21 people with automatic weapons!

232
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,980
The infiltration will prevent a serious
criminal act.

233
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,880
This is our only chance.
- We're not Russians, Kochi.

234
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,180
We're not 300 million to
attack, kill, and terrorize.

235
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,780
and the flea bit the bear.

236
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,980
I will personally lead the operation.
I guarantee the lives of the patients...

237
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,580
Enough, that's sufficient, Koçi.

238
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,780
We have never messed up
a situation like yours.

239
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,280
Communists ruled us for 50 years,
half of Montenegro,

240
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,980
brought us to begging with a stick.
And now, the old song with a new voice.

241
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,380
I won't send my people inside,
to become a laughingstock.

242
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,880
The life of even one person
is more valuable to me than all praises

243
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
from Lyon and Brussels and...

244
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,080
Chief, don't move!
The wheelchair...

245
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,680
Please don't move.
They'll reopen your wounds.

246
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,580
The wheelchair.
Don't. He needs to see... to hear.

247
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,280
Who ordered Dardan's murder?
Who?

248
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Who?

249
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,680
Who?
Your brother-in-law.

250
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,880
Your brother-in-law!

251
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,080
Your brother-in-law.

252
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,280
He still doesn't move.

253
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,580
Tonight, I'll tell her everything.

254
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,580
Go home. Listen to me,
go home while you still have someone.

255
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,880
I just spoke with the Minister
of Internal Affairs personally.

256
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,580
They are preparing an emergency risk analysis.

257
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,480
We'll learn his decision soon.
That's good.

258
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,380
The moment they stormed
a public institution armed

259
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,980
with rifles, they defined themselves
as terrorists.

260
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,580
Can I ask you something?
What?

261
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,080
Whatever the Minister decides,
please don't take matters into your own hands.

262
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,880
Don't worry.
That's my job.

263
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,320
Until soon.

264
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,820
What if he wakes up
while he's in the coffin?

265
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,120
No, they gave him a sedative.
He'll wake up in Kosovo.

266
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,720
Easy... like this...

267
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,520
It's not so bad here.

268
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,920
You come with me. We'll go upstairs
to wait for that dog.

269
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,620
Really?

270
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,420
Okay.

271
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,820
Looks like they got permission
to storm.

272
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,220
Don't worry, everything will be fine!

273
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,820
I've got everything under control.

274
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,120
Those who shot Dardan
were wearing police uniforms.

275
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,920
How do we know it's not one of them?
Trust me, they're my concern.

276
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,320
Special forces are coming.

277
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,720
What are we going to do?
We'll wait. We'll wait!

278
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,120
Listen. The Minister said yes.
Get your people ready.

279
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,220
Where are you going?
I'm driving two corpses to Podgorica.

280
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,920
They'll be buried tomorrow.

281
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,920
Open from the back!

282
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,620
Open the coffin!
Bad luck will catch up with me!

283
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,020
Open it!

284
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,620
You open it, I don't dare.
Neighbor, don't open that, please.

285
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,420
Neighbor, don't open this one,
I beg you.

286
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,320
<i>To everyone! Take positions
to start the operation.</i>

287
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,520
Ready.
This is my uncle.

288
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,020
He died of skin cancer.
His whole body decayed.

289
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Open the other one.
A young kid, a sympathizer.

290
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,420
Attack!
Let's go, run!

291
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,020
Attack! Attack!

292
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,720
You all know your job.

293
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,020
Find Dardan!
Forward!

294
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,820
Kneel! Kneel! Down!

295
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Down! Down!

296
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,220
Everyone down!

297
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,720
Scander...
Good day, Inspector Koçi.

298
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,120
What's happening here?
Nothing.

299
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,120
We waited for you to come
so we could go home.

300
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,920
Where's your nephew?
He went out to smoke a cigarette.

301
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,320
There's no one.

302
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,920
What's this?
What is all this nonsense?

303
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,820
Where is Dardan?
Maybe he got better and went home.

304
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,320
You attacked the hospital,
took hostages.

305
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,920
Do you think you'll get away with it?
Well, arrest us then.

306
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,420
But I don't see
how that will bring back your father.

307
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,020
Let's run away from here.
Come on, quickly!

308
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,420
We're leaving.
Spasoje...

309
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,120
Hello! Koçi...

310
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,120
Interpol can't solve everything!
This is Montenegro, legend.

311
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,220
Follow me!

312
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,900
<b>REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO</b>

313
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,600
Yes, I'm here.

314
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,000
Yes, I understand.

315
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Yes, no problem.

316
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,800
Hello?
Hello, little sister. How are you?

317
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,200
Alive, but I'd be better off dead.

318
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,000
Don't say that. Be strong.

319
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,800
How is Agime, how? Tell me how,
because I no longer know how to be strong?

320
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,200
What kind of person would shoot at children?

321
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Does he have a soul, a conscience?
How does he walk on this earth?

322
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,700
How, brother?

323
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,300
What kind of person is this?

324
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,500
<i>Currently, there's no connection
with this number...</i>

325
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,200
Uroš?

326
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,600
We need to talk.

327
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,200
