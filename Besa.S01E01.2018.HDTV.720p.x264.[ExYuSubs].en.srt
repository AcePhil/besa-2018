5
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,980
The little beasts are up!
We're coming, enough of lazing around!

6
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,580
Are you having sex again?
What else should we do?

7
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,380
Aren't we going to have breakfast today?

8
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,680
No, today the Peri膰 family is on fasting and prayer!

9
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,380
The little one can't fast and pray,
so get up and make us breakfast!

10
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,380
The maid Maria Peri膰 is on it.
Maid Maria, hurry up!

11
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,580
Yes!

12
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,080
It has grown a bit,
I would say in the middle of the head,

13
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,880
Soon you'll need to shave it bald.

14
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,480
No! We'll sell the vans and get ourselves a convertible.

15
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,580
Let the wind blow through your hair as you drive.
It'll be great fun!

16
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,180
Stop playing with that
phone on the table, please!

17
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,980
I'll stop when I'm done.
Please, stop right away.

18
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,250
I'll stop when I'm done!
And why aren't you eating?

19
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,240
My head hurts.
Don't lie, kid!

20
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,740
I can't go to school if my head hurts!

21
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,980
Don't you want us to call an ambulance?
Have them take you away on a stretcher?

22
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,280
And you, don't eat so much bread!
Why, what's wrong with him?

23
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,880
What's wrong with him?
Look at this!

24
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,460
He supposedly does
push-ups, but none!

We've attached the best from the unit
for the protection of witnesses to him.

34
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,520

Are there any survivors? No.

48
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,730
Who was driving the car?
Minich.

49
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,190
One of the deceased.
They were good people.

50
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
They'll weigh on your conscience,
you understand, right?

51
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,200
The safety of the witness
was your responsibility.

52
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,160
Why didn't you check the car?
Listen, tarikat!

53
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,630
Minich baptized my child,
he was my godfather.

that we're all one here.

58
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,400
And I think we're done here.
I saw everything.

I'll call Premovi膰

60
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,300

Cops wouldn't kill their own colleague.

61
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,940
So you think he's just an idiot?
I'm sure.

You know my relative, Isa...

80
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,760
He started smuggling
some guys from Albania.

81
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,060
And where did you learn about that?

82
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,160
He called me to drive the motorboat.

83
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,340
Tonight, 15 kilos arrive from Shkodra

84
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,820
and he wants to take them to Italy.

85
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,300
I told him:

86
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,810
"Don't do anything stupid, no one dares
to work behind Dardan's back."

87
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,490
If you mention that name again,
I'll kill you! Do you hear me?

88
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,090
I'll tear your head off, you understand?

89
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,880
Sorry, sorry. I dropped out.

90
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,560
What happened, asshole?
Did you shit yourself?

91
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,530
I told Isa:

92
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,460
"Don't do anything,
the boss will fuck you up."

93
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,080
And he says to me: "I'm my own boss,
I don't give a fuck about everyone!"

94
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,700
Hashim, won't you say a good word
to the boss for me?

95
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,260
God help us, boss.

96
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,020
He'll help if we keep
to the agreements.

97
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,920
I know, I forgot last night.
I'll wash it now.

98
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,660
Hello, people!
Hello, boss.

99
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,250
How's your wife?
Like a little elephant. She's rolling already.

100
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,800
So, like you? Emira?

101
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,600
Did anyone pay anything?
Nothing, boss.

102
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,560
And the bank?
The installment is in five days.

103
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,030
Oh, that's a disaster!
It would be.

104
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,230
If it weren't for the order from Montenegro.
It will cover the loan,

105
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,690
there will be money for salaries.
Excellent!

106
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,660
Come on, let's go, let's go!

107
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,120

110
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,060
Come on, watch it!

111
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,020
What are you doing?
Sorry.

112
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Come on.

113
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,720
Bravo!
Damn, three against two is nothing!

114
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,920
They're not that good; we're just bad.
The chubby one wasn't running at all.!

115
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,220
Here's the beer! I was done
with basketball, find someone else.

116
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,060
Misha...
Hey, you!

117
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
What's up?

118
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,220
What's going on?

119
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,400
My foolishness struck again.
Lymph nodes.

120
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,100
How? Everything was fine, right?

121
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,600
Oh, fuck the mother...
Wait, wait...

122
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,100
It was, damn it, but not anymore.

123
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,500
And now what?
Now biopsy...

124
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,660
If something's wrong, which it's not,
I'll be back in the hospital...

125
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,200
...full program.

126
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,240
Everything will be fine, brother.
Everything will be okay!

127
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,940
It'll be okay next time!
Enough of the nonsense.

128
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,680
Koci! You look good.

129
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,660
Look at him, fit as a fiddle.

130
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,660
That's how it should be, son.

131
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,860
And since I'm not operational,
I look like someone's grandpa, damn it!

132
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,180
And what can I do for you?

133
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,880
How is it that your people
failed to protect

134
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,680
the only witness
against Dardan Berisha?

135
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,320
A bomb under the car!
Who would have guessed?

136
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,970
If you had included me in the security,
the man would still be alive.

137
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,800
We deliberately chose the team.
Brussels may mourn the death

138
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,100
of a few locals,
but your death would have been...

139
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,400
If I let you interfere
with operational work...

140
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
... I risk a lot.

141
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,800
You risk more
if you don't leave me alone.

142
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,000
You're Albanian, right?
Paternally.

143
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,800
My mother is Serbian.
And my mother is Slovenian.

144
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,600
But that doesn't help me in Ljubljana.

145
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,600
Not a single Serbian cop
will want to cooperate with you.

146
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,700
For one year, so much...
Let's get to the point, General.

147
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,300
If we work together, I will lobby for you
in The Hague and Brussels.

148
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,900
Son, do you know how much
I don't care about The Hague and Brussels?

149
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Mr. Premovic, you are appointed
directly by Brussels, right?

150
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Exactly.

151
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,900
So it would be good to be friends.
And very bad if we aren't.

152
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,500
Especially after the death
of a protected witness.

153
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,300
And now what? Shall we kiss?

154
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,100
To start with, it would be good
to cooperate, General.

155
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I don't know why you keep carrying
stuff when you have everything.

156
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Maria sends her regards.
Thanks. How are the kids?

157
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Growing.

158
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
They forgot how you look.

159
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,000
Shall we shoot a bit? No.

160
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,200
If you hit all four bottles,
I'll give you 500 bucks.

161
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,600
Drop it.
You dare to try, huh?

162
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,700
Let's make a deal:
if I hit, you quit smoking.

163
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
And if you miss?

164
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,400
I'll buy you a carton
for every miss.

165
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,500
That's four cartons,
I'll have enough to smoke until the end of the month!

166
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,000
Let's see you.

167
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,100
What's with the weapon taking?

168
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,260
You're endangering not only your own,
but also others' safety.

169
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,920
You're disrupting my concentration,
Major, huh?

170
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,700
Military psychology

00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,300
page 63. "Breaking the
enemy's military morale."

172
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,360
See,
how well I raised you?

173
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,590
That's why I did it.
Because you raised me well.

174
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,000
Quit smoking from the 1st.

175
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,900
How's it going?
It hurts!

176
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,100
It needs to hurt a bit.
Come on, pull it up.

177
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,500
Come on, sweetheart, pull it up.

178
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,100
Come on.
I can't anymore! Please, don't!

179
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,500
Tell her, please!
She has nothing to tell me,

180
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,900
Sister Bilya is a great friend of yours,
but you don't want to limp, right?

181
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Come on, pull it up!

182
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,300
Come on, pull it up again. Like this.
Enough, that's enough...

183
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,800
No, one more time. One more time.

184
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,210
Come on.
A moment of rest.

185
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,510
Do you know what kind of break I'll give you?
Come on!

186
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,200
There you go, see it's happening. Good.
Good.

187
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Well done. Well done, you!

188
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,240
Take a little rest, and then again.

<b>SPLIT CROATIA</b>

190
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,500
Hello, Mare, dear!
What's going on with you?

191
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,140
Nothing, everything is fine.
What else can happen?

192
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,640
How are the kids?
He's great.

193
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,840
And she's a disaster,
doing whatever she wants.

194
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,840
I wonder who she's after.

195
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,440
And how is my son-in-law?
He's good. You know him, right?

196
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,140
Always aiming high,
but he's good at everything else.

197
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,940
How is it in Split?
What are you doing?

198
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,540
We went out for a stroll.
See the sea.

199
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,200
Is the tank full?

200
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Don't worry, this boat has loaded
half of Montenegro with cigarettes.

201
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Isa!

202
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,540
Where are you going, lad?
Come back, it's Hashim!

203
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:21,340
Hashim? Is that you?
It's me, brother.

204
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,820
Did he get scared of me
or this broad?

205
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
I'm transporting cigarettes to Italy.

206
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,420
I know, I know. Come, come.

207
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,720
Don't you know that my boss allowed it?

208
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,900
Come on, don't be a bitch!
Get up, get up!

209
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,000
You have to get used to these things.

210
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,240
I rewarded him. Now he's peaceful,
but he flies and is happy.

211
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,740
Don't be afraid.
Wipe your mouth.

212
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,040
Listen to me now.

213
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,500
I knew you were a good boy,
but this much, I didn't believe!

214
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,800
Thank you, Hashim.

215
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,640
I hope now you'll say a kind word
about me to Dardan?

216
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,440
Fuck your mother, boy!

217
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,640
I told you a hundred times not to mention
that name, damn it!

218
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
He was as dumb as an ass.

219
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,840
And he had no idea
what he was getting into.

220
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,340
Come on, boys. Move.

221
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,340
Pick up these crates
and throw them there!

222
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,740
Come on, quickly, move!
Let's go, come on!

223
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,460
Hello?

224
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,180
Tell me.

225
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,380
Yes.
And what's happening with Jole?

226
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,490
Damn it!

227
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,920
Okay. Nothing.

228
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,560
I'll be there in half an hour.
Come.

229
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,720
What's up?
Nothing.

230
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,600
Mira, Jole's wife is giving birth.

231
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,180
What does that have to do with you?
You're not going to deliver it, are you?

232
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,670
It has something to do with me.
I have to drive instead of Jole to Montenegro.

233
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,200
Tonight.

234
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,700
Come on, Mr. Peric. Here we are.

235
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,220
Come on, I'm leaving.
Come.

236
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,700
Kiss the kids when they wake up.
Come on, bye.

237
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Bye.

238
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,240
What's up? Oh!

239
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,320
Come on. I love you.
Come on. Bye.

<b>LION FRANCE</b>

241
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,050
<b>INTERPOL</b>

242
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,790
Sead Jafirovic, he was a protected witness
in the case against Dardan Berisha.

243
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,220
Berisha controls 30%
of the heroin traffic,

244
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,080
originating from Afghanistan into Europe through Turkey.

245
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,880
He imports drugs into the region with impunity.

246
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,500
He's associated with extortions, human trafficking, and murder.

247
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,900
We know all this, you know all this,
yet he remains a free man. Why?

248
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,800
Because he's supported by corrupt government officials.

249
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,800
The Berisha clan absorbed vast amounts of Kosovo capital after the Balkans conflict.

250
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,400
We believe that they're using this money
to bribe local politicians,

251
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,600
judges, and police officers across the whole of Eastern Europe.

252
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,000
The clan is doing business with similar organizations

253
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,320
in Macedonia, Bosnia, Montenegro, and Serbia.

254
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,900
In 10 years, Interpol has not been able
to bring a single witness to testify against him.

255
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,380
Some vanished, others simply changed their testimonies.

256
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,780
Some, like Seat Jaferovic, were murdered

257
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,780
while they were on the police protection.

258
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,680
So everything produced and smuggled out of the Balkans

259
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,540
by the Berisha clan is received and distributed
into the West by the Sokoly clan,

260
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Led by Agim Sokoli.

261
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,120
The two clans were united by Berisha married Sokoly's sister to create a blood tie.

262
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,820
In truth, it remains an uneasy alliance,

263
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,120
which, despite this marriage, could still lead to war between two clans.

264
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,820
We must stop Dardan Berisha before that happens.

265
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,220
Also, we have BESA to deal with.
BESA?

266
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,420
It's a code of conduct.

267
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,420
BESA is an Albanian cultural precept,

268
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,620
Usually translates to "faith"
which means to keep the promise and word of honor.

269
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,320
But within the Mafia clan,
breaking the BESA means certain death.

270
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,240
We understood that the budget increase
would be used for buying intel,

271
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,060
for forming a network similar to the one
that this organization has.

272
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,300
You intend to bribe politicians, judges,
and police officers, Inspector Kochi?

273
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,760
To fight fire with fire?

274
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,460
No, I don't think that's what the inspector is saying.

275
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,280
Then what is he saying?
That he needs more money.

276
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,120
If you give me these extra resources,

277
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,160
I will bring Dardan Berisha to justice.
