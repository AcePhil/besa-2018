Get ready!
We're going to Kosovo.

28
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
To Kosovo?

29
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,780
Everything is here.
Children go to school here.

30
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,380
We have no choice. It's become dangerous here.
For the whole family.

31
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,580
Besiana's grave is here.

32
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,380
We'll move her there.
We'll move everything. Pack your bags!

33
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,380
Hello, love?
Hey!

34
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,480
What's happening?
I've been in meetings all day.

35
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,180
And how is it going?
What can I tell you?

36
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,180
He's offering me to become
his main representative in Serbia.

37
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,680
And you know how it is with customs.
Yes.

38
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,780
And when are you coming back?

39
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,180
It should be tomorrow morning.

40
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,980
I have another meeting in the afternoon,
and tonight I'm invited for lamb.

41
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,580
I can't refuse.
Okay.

42
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,180
Which hotel did you say you were staying at?

43
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,680
Maria, I have to go to a meeting at OUME.
What did he say?

44
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,580
Come on, we'll talk later. Bye.

45
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,980
Did something happen to dad?
Yes.

46
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,080
Come on, mom, he'll be okay.

47
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,780
The girl he killed was my age.
How can he not go crazy?

48
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,780
We're leaving in three days.

49
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,880
The four of us are leaving and
another ten people that Hashim will choose.

50
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,980
First, we'll stay at Skender's house.

51
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,480
And then we'll see.
Any questions?

52
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,580
Can I stay here?
To command those who remain?

53
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,780
Why?

54
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,080
My wife is pregnant...

55
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,080
Again?  What can you do?

56
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,380
And she might be pregnant.
I need everyone.

57
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,880
Anyone who wants can
take their family. Hashim...

58
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,180
It's not easy for him...

59
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,980
Neither does he have a wife, nor does he care.

60
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,480
I care.

61
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,080
You'll become a great lover...

62
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,980
That's right. I'm not a count like you.

63
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,380
Hashim, one more thing...
When did you last have sex?

64
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,880
Last year, I had a little encounter...
But it's as if I haven't.

65
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,480
But it's as if I haven't.

66
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,480
He's my fucker!

67
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,480
In three days, everything has to be ready.

68
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,180
Everything has to continue,
as if we're still here.

69
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,480
The business here will be run
by the fat Riza.

70
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
Understood?

71
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,480
Blazo, every time you look at me
as if you want to kill me on the spot!

72
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,480
If I didn't kill you when you killed
my son-in-law and brought my niece

73
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,280
for me to take care of,
it means I won't now.

74
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,380
I saved her life, Blazo!
- That's why I let you live!

75
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,980
And staining our honor,
sooner or later, it will come back to you.

76
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,180
Maybe.

77
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,880
But not from you.
- Not from me. I gave you my word.

78
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,080
And I gave you a grandson!

79
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,080
Yes, he gave me a grandson!

80
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,280
Ask him.
He might let you stay here.

81
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,880
I already asked him.

82
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,080
Hashim doesn't ask for a living,
he prays.

83
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,280
Yes.

84
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,980
You've set aside enough money
for a rainy day.

85
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,080
You knew that these days would come.

86
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Here they are.
It's time to run.

87
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,580
Where will we run?
Where won't Dardan find us?

88
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,780
It would have been better if he had killed me,
as he ordered you!

89
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,780
Please, don't leave!

90
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,480
I'll die without you!

91
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,280
I have no choice.

92
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,180
I'll prepare something for you to eat.

93
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,180
What would you like?
- Double espresso and Coca-Cola.

94
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,680
Of course.

95
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,380
Can I have a double espresso
and Coca-Cola?

96
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,780
Here you go.
- Thank you.

97
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,480
I didn't order wine, no.

98
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,850
Uki-Tuki?

99
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,040
Oh, man...
Now you have to say Ivek-Pimpek!

100
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,840
Ivan.
- Oh, brother...

101
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,040
Ivan!
- Where are you, man?

102
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,780
Where are you going, my Uki?
Uki-Tuki!

103
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,980
I can't believe it.
- What brings you here?

104
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,680
Sit.
- It's a long story.

105
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,380
Well, if it's long, start.
Take your time...

106
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,580
Come on!
- Ah, no, no, no

107
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,180
Don't be early for me!
- Come on, start. Let me hear you.

108
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,180
And you, what are you doing here?
- Well, I live here.

109
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,880
Wait, weren't you in Zagreb?

110
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,680
I got married, got divorced...
My wife took the apartment...

111
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,980
My second wife was a tavern keeper.
And she deceived me.

112
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,680
And I bought this trap from her.
That's how my luck was!

113
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,180
Such was my fate!

114
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,960
And you? Tell me!
- Well...

115
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,360
I'm here because of a girl.
- Oh!

116
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,460
If my wife finds out, she'll kill me.

117
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,660
Damn it! Do you know, I've always envied you.

118
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,360
For the pieces. I mean,
for the girls. Always.

119
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,160
Belgrade girls, huh?

120
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,560
You know...
I haven't been there

121
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,960
since we finished high school.

122
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,660
Damn. What's there to do?

123
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,060
Man...

124
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,160
I'll never forget
how you saved me back then.

125
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,260
When the nationalists were beating me.
- I didn't save you...

126
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,960
On the contrary.
- You're exaggerating, it was nothing.

127
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,660
On the contrary.
- They wouldn't have killed you.

128
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,060
No, they would just beat me up.

129
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,260
Just that they buried me in concrete
and cursed my Croatian mother!

130
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,960
Because I wouldn't take off
the Partizan shirt from underneath.

131
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,760
How could I take it off when
I had a Dinamo shirt underneath?

132
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,060
If I knew that, I would never
have jumped them. Luckily, I didn't know.

133
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Hey, little one!

134
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,960
Bring another pitcher.
Please, come on.

135
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,660
Man, everyone stood and watched,
the whole school.

136
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,460
And out of everyone, only you jumped
to save me.

137
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:22,060
Uki, that's unforgettable. Even after
a concussion.

138
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,760
Yes, that's right. You saved my life, Uki.
- It's not like that, you're exaggerating.

139
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,160
Life!
- Yes, indeed.

140
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,860
Hey, you know how glad I am
to meet you!

141
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,860
We should celebrate tonight.
- The girl is waiting for me, I can't.

142
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Okay, then tomorrow, but first
I'll take you to lunch,

143
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,860
and then we'll sit down
and have a drink, okay? Please.

144
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,360
Which hotel are you staying at?

145
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,660
Ivek-Pimpek. Why do you ask so much?

146
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,160
Excuse me. And where is your girl?

147
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,260
There she is.

148
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,360
Aim high, damn it.
Come on.

149
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,160
Come on, I'll take you by boat.
- How? There's no...

150
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,560
Come on, let's go...
- Don't say a word!

151
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,860
Come on!
- There's a boat every 15 minutes...

152
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,660
We won't argue now.
- No need, really...

153
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,060
Let's go!
- Wait, I'll pay the bill...

154
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,560
No, no, no! I'll handle it.
Write it on me!

155
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,960
Please, brother! Uki.
- Don't do this.

156
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,480
The money of my fellow student
doesn't matter here!

157
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,280
No need, I have a reservation...
- We're leaving, let's go!

158
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,680
No need for you to drive me...
- We're leaving.

159
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,780
Here, take it.
- Look at that guy with the BMW!

160
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Where?

161
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,880
Take the phone.
- What?

162
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,780
We'll see each other tomorrow, right?
- Where are you going, hello?

163
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,180
"This is him."

164
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,980
Well, hello.

165
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,280
Where are you in such a hurry?

166
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,880
Will you tell me who arranged you like this?

167
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,080
Ah, Luka? I won't be mad,
if it's because of some girl.

168
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,480
Luka?

169
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,680
What's up?

170
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,580
Una, we can't see each other anymore.

171
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
What?

172
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,280
Are you kidding?

173
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,080
I'm not kidding.

174
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,480
And why?
- I can't explain it to you.

175
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,280
What can't you explain to me?

176
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,680
Don't call me anymore and
drag me into the café, okay?

177
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Luka, huh?

178
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,080
So what? He fooled me and dumped me?
- I fooled you, yes. So what?

179
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,480
<b>LION</b>

180
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,080
<b>INTERPOL</b>

181
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,280
This is from Mr. Berisha's lawyer,
Adnan Braha.

182
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,820
There are some quite serious
accusations against you.

183
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,920
Mr. Braha claims that when taking
DNA samples,

184
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
you exceeded your authority

185
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,220
and unlawfully arrested his client.

186
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,920
Yes. Mr. Braha is a criminal.

187
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,920
As well as his clients.
- Allow me to finish, miss.

188
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,820
He also claims that instead of taking
samples from his clients,

189
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,020
you organized an operation
to arrest them.

190
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,520
And thus you have threatened the lives not only
of Mr. Berisha and his associates,

191
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,520
but also of his son, who is still a child.

192
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,520
That "child" pulled a gun
against the police.

193
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,620
Is it true that you used offensive
words for Mr. Berisha's daughter,

194
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,820
which almost led to
physical confrontation?

195
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,920
Yes, it is true.

196
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,820
I wanted to provoke him
to do something,

197
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,420
for which I could arrest him.

198
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,820
While he is free,

199
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,520
the whole region will sink into chaos,
so...

200
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,220
This provocation may
cost us dearly.

201
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,220
Berisha's lawyer will probably
file a complaint with Interpol

202
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,820
and seek a huge compensation.
And you know,

203
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,620
that this will automatically lead
to your removal.

204
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,220
Then remove me.

205
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,120
Please?
- If he leaves, I leave too.

206
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,120
Yes. Get rid of us.

207
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,320
But with this move, you will admit
that they are unbeatable.

208
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,420
Mr. Kochi...
- Yes?

209
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,320
Consider this as a final warning.

210
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,420
Thank you,
for this last chance.

211
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,320
Hello, sister. How are you?!

212
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,520
I want to ask you something.
Tell me!

213
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,620
Dardan ordered everyone to move
to Kosovo. I don't want to live there.

214
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,320
Haven't you discussed it?

215
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,420
We did, but it's like
talking to a wall.

216
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,020
Alright. I'll try
to talk to him.

217
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,120
And you can come
to me for the weekend.

218
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,020
I'll send a plane to pick you up.

219
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Alright, I'll come.
If he allows...

220
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,320
Is he treating you roughly?
No, he's not rough with me.

221
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,320
You know, if it weren't for the kids,
I would have escaped in a heartbeat.

222
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,020
Don't talk like that. He's your husband.

223
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,320
Come to me for the weekend.

224
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,920
I'll convince him to let you go.

225
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,520
Alright.

226
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,020
Let's go.

227
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,220
I talked to Agim.

228
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,420
He invited us with the kids
to go to him for the weekend.

229
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,620
Good.

230
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,620
Are we going now?
Go.

231
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,220
You need to go, be
with your family for a bit.

232
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,720
But the kids stay here.

233
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Why?
Because I say so.

234
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,720
Agim, the boss...

235
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,820
He's heard a lot of good things about you.

236
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,420
He's offering you a job.

237
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:14,220
If he knows everything about me,
then he knows I'm not a traitor.

238
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,620
Why like this, man?

239
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,920
And as for betrayal...
Let me tell you...

240
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,520
You betrayed Dardan that night,
when you didn't follow his order.

241
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,220
And saved this one's life.

242
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,320
Where did you learn about her?

243
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,420
Kill us both.

244
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,220
Just don't touch my niece.

245
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,620
Spare my grandson.

246
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,420
Please.
Should I kill you?

247
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,020
Why should I kill you?

248
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,220
Regain your honor, kill yourself.

249
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,520
Don't squeal at me like a pussy.
See, I'm talking to a man.

250
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,120
Oh, Hashim, Hashim...

251
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,520
I had my people follow you.

252
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,820
They told me you were sneaking
into the house of some Montenegrin.

253
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,420
And I thought: "What's going on?"

254
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,320
Why do you go there?
Are you perhaps a fag?

255
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,020
Are you fags?
Oh, guys?

256
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,920
It's not homosexuality, not drugs...

257
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:59,620
You're not gay? Right, guys?

258
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,420
No... no chance.

259
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,820
Well, then Hashim must
have some secret.

260
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,620
Some big secret
he's hiding from me.

261
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,720
See what's going on.

262
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,620
If you help us, you'll take
Dardan's place

263
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,020
and you'll receive 10 million euros
in a Swiss bank.

264
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,020
And if I don't help?

265
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,320
Then there will be
three funerals in Ulcinj.

266
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,020
And three coffins decorated
with Montenegrin ornaments.

267
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,620
Fuck, it took forever.

268
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,820
And you haven't moved, damn it!

269
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,420
You haven't changed at all,
a little here, but you're fine.

270
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,220
No wonder you fuck them all,
damn your mother!

271
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,720
Hey, I'm going to see
what's going on.

272
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,320
If I don't come back in half an hour,
disappear!

273
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,220
I'll call you when to come
and pick me up.

274
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,500
Come on!
Go!

275
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,900
Go, come on!
- What's happening, damn it?

276
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,800
Go!

277
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,400
Go quickly!
- Here, I'm going.

278
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,500
Go, go, brother, go!

279
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,900
Metya! Metya!

280
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,110
What happened with the knocking?

281
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,210
Her husband came home.

282
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,610
If you fuck married women,
they'll catch you someday, my friend.

283
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,210
You know what they say? "You can't
shake without getting slapped"!

284
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,010
Come on, hit one to calm down.

285
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,910
Oh damn, why did he close it?

286
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,010
Do you want?

287
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,600
Hey! Turn, turn!

288
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,900
Turn, turn that way!
Turn that way, come on! That way!

289
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,200
Relax, now I'll...
- Turn that way, damn it!

290
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,500
Turn!

291
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,000
Go, gas, gas!

292
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Go quickly, brother!

293
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
Go, Ivan!

294
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,620
<i>Uki-Tuki.
Oh, man...</i>

295
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,220
<i>Now you have to say
Ivek-Pimpek.</i>

296
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,600
<i>Ivan.</i>

297
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,500
<i>Uki-Tuki!
Oh, man...</i>

298
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,300
<i>Now you have to say Ivek-Pimpek.
Ivan.</i>

299
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,200
<i>You know what they say? "You can't
shake without getting slapped"!</i>

300
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,100
<i>Everyone stood and watched,
the whole high school.</i>

301
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,700
<i>And only you jumped to defend me.</i>

302
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,900
<i>You saved my life, Uki!</i>
