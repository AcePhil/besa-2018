Me?</i>

<i>Yes. And someone named Mima
sends you greetings.</i>

<i>Who is Mima?</i>

9
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:32,505
<i>I returned his son.
Come on, finish your job.</i>

10
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:49,405
<i>Congratulations on your new appointment.</i>

11
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:52,805
<i>Now you are the head of the Kosovo
Privatization Agency.</i>

12

<i>I think it would be fair
if I also benefit from this job.</i>

13

<i>Don't stick your nose in my business!</i>

14
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,805
<i>Period!</i>

15
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:08,005
<i>Very strange!
What's strange?</i>

16
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:10,805
<i>There are too many bullets.</i>

17

<i>Good day.
Good day, Mrs. Peric.</i>

<i>Is your husband at home?</i>

20
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:36,805
Do you mind
if we record the conversation?

21
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:39,305
No.
Why are you recording?

22
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:42,405
Maria... Let people do their jobs.

23
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:45,505
Mrs. Peric, we're on your side.

24
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:49,505
If you don't want to talk
here, we can call you...

25
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:52,605
Please, feel free to record.
Thank you.

26
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:57,205
Mr. Peric, have you heard
that David Bey was killed last night?

27
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:02,305
Yes.

28
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:05,205
We believe it's a case
of professional murder.

29
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:08,905
And why are you telling me this?
Two weeks ago in Ulcinj,

30
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:13,005
Boro Zamovich was killed. Someone bit off
his testicles and beat him to death.

31
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:16,805
They left unnecessary traces.
What does this have to do with me?

32
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:20,745
Behind these murders
is Dardan Berisha.

33
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:25,645
There's a good chance
you're his next target.

34
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:29,445
Why do you think that?
Mrs. Peric,

35
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:34,045
both victims are connected
to the death of Besiana Berisha.

36
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:36,745
There's only one more left.

37
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:43,745
I won't be caught.
And why are you so sure?

38
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:50,045
That night, when...
when they released me from custody,

39
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:54,745
I was abducted by Dardan's men.
They wanted to kill me.

40
00:02:55,745 --> 00:02:58,445
And? What happened next?

41
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:05,845
He gave up.  He learned that his daughter was
driving under the influence of drugs and...

42
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:10,945
It's quite unusual that
Dardan Berisha just let you go.

43
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:14,645
What do you mean, just like that?
They beat him up!

44
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:17,945
And you didn't think
it was necessary to tell us?

45
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:22,145
What were we supposed to tell you?
These are mobsters, and we're just ordinary people...

46
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:26,445
Dardan Berisha had a friendly chat
with David Bey as well.

47
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:30,245
And just a day after that, David Bey
was killed.

48
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:34,245
It's very important to understand
that people like Berisha

49
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:38,445
wipe out entire families
without blinking an eye.

50
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:43,145
And... Is that all?
Yes.

51
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:47,045
If you want, we can ensure
your safety.

52
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:50,345
There won't be a need.
And how will you do that?

53
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:53,045
We will assign police to monitor
your house 24/7.

54
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:55,245
Well...
There really is no need...

55
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,645
Why?
Maria, there's no need.

56
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:04,945
Mrs. Peric, thank you.

57
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,145
I'll show you out.

58
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:15,745
If you reconsider.

59
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:36,545
We'll stay in touch, Mr. Peric.
So be it.

60
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:40,645
Thank you for the conversation.
Have a nice day.

61
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:59,445
There's something suspicious about that guy.

62
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:04,145
Take your position.
Move!

63
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:37,045
I think we should accept
this police protection.

64
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:41,645
And then what?
And then what?

65
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,845
We'll have to be guarded for a lifetime.

66
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:51,645
What do you suggest?

67
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:55,245
Should I take the kids to Split to stay
with our family and wait to be killed?

68
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,445
Is that it?

69
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:24,845
Did the biker leave?
He left,

70
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:27,645
but someone parked a gray Citroen
in his place.

71
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,045
Really?
Most likely.

Rajko Lalic. Chief
of Montenegro's MUP,

95
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:47,505
a general from the old school.
Tough, relatively clean,

96
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:49,705

Good day.

Thank you for coming.
Please sit.

99
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:02,105
As you probably already know,
things have become more complicated.

100
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,905
Wonderful, if you love.
Yes. Over the past three weeks

101
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,305
there have been several murders,
which we believe,

102
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:11,405
are ordered, perhaps even committed
by the Dardan Berisha clan.

103
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:15,005
We know about the murders, but we haven't
heard of any evidence.

104
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:17,605
General, you know very well

105
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:21,105
that the Berisha clan operates
very professionally

106
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,905
and there's never anything
to catch them on. And even when there is, they...

107
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:28,505
Remain inaccessible.
So, I have a new idea.

108
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,705
I've got support from Lyon.

109
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:33,605
Kotse, sorry...
But Raiko and I plan to watch

110
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:36,505
the Partizan match tonight,

111
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:38,905
and we also have a
social event on the schedule.

112
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,705
How long will this take?
We won't delay, I promise.

113
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:45,205
General, the problem is that I won't
succeed without your help.

114
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:49,205
I'm listening.
I want the Montenegro Police,

115
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:52,905
to conduct an operation to arrest
Dardan Berisha and his lieutenants.

116
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,605
On what grounds?
Taking DNA samples.

117
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:58,105
We hope
someone left evidence.

118
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:05,105
To me, Inspector, this seems
like a desperate move.

119
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:07,505
At the moment, we have nothing better.

120
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:10,105
And this will allow us
to interrogate them.

121
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:13,405
Maybe someone will give in.
General?

122
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:17,805
And when do you want this to happen?
Tomorrow.

123
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,905
We have international support
for the operation, and you have the people.

124
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:23,805
The only thing
that remains is the order.

125
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:28,905
And who will sign this order?
Judge Bazhdarevich. Your son-in-law.

126
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:33,905
Do you want me to put a stone
around my sister's husband's neck?

127
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:36,905
General, in Lyon, they are strongly
concerned about the fact

128
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:40,305
that the latest victim
of the Berisha clan,

129
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:43,105
is a British citizen.

130
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,505
Can I tell you something
unofficially?

131
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:47,705
Of course, tell me.

132
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:51,205
I wouldn't bet a penny
on Lyon or Europe!

133
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,405
Is that unofficial?

134
00:12:56,305 --> 00:13:00,605
Thank you for being so honest.
Especially when your mandate is running out.

the Minister of Internal Affairs' chair.

136

Hello?
Something interesting has come up.

00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,305
Yes, I'm listening.
Today, the agency received

00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:39,205
another set of documents
for participation in the auction.

142

From a Croatian company
called "Adria Nord."

143
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:45,205
They've built some large hotels
along the Adriatic coast.

144
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:48,975
Should I inform your favorite?

00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:52,365
Of course. Immediately.
Are you sure?

Goodbye, sweetheart.

I'm afraid we have a problem.

148
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:25,205
We're traveling to Montenegro tomorrow.
Okay, I have something to take care of.

149
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:03,805
And? What did the cop who visited you say?

150
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,305
He said I'm in danger because of
the accident I was involved in.

151
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,705
He's questioning me about...
Hey!

152
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,905
No names!
He's questioning me about your friend.

153
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:19,905
I told him we met.
And that he forgave me

154
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:22,505
when he found out his daughter
was driving drugged.

155
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:27,705
Then why is the police following you?

156
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:31,005
What police?

157
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,905
You have a tail - a silver Citroen.

158
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:40,385
A package will be waiting for you at the office.

159
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:44,385
Call me when you open it.

160

163
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:04,585
Did you open it?
Why do I have two passports?

164
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:07,185
One for abroad and one for the hotel.

165
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,185
Leave your phone.
The one in the package

166
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:15,385
has a Bosnian ID. Tell your wife
you're going to Banja Luka.

167
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:18,585
You leave tonight.

168
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:24,885
You'll see, Rovinj is great!
Swim there for me.

Thank you.
I have a question.

175
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:39,185
Yes?
Why me?

176
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,885
Because you've got balls.

177
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:45,685
That way, my kids will feel at ease,
lifting me in the air.

That won't happen.
From now on,

179
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:51,285
Mr. Lekic is responsible
for your personal safety.

180
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:55,185
He's no longer part of the Interpol team
and can fully focus on you.

181
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,785
Yes. That's what I was afraid of.

182
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:00,985
If something happens to
Mr. Bazhdarevich and his family,

183
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:03,385
I'll personally hold you responsible.

If you say so.

00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:30,685
How many times have I told you
never to touch it?

186
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:34,385
Do you think that makes you a man?

187
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:37,785
No! It makes you this.

188
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:42,485

00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:46,385

Don't!

00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:09,985
Don't!
We're not cowards to surrender.

193
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:15,385
Drop the gun,
We won't surrender, Dad!

194
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:19,585
Listen to your father.
Give me the shotgun.

195
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,585
Like this.

196
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:32,785
Here.

197
00:20:33,185 --> 00:20:35,585
The little one will have to come with us.

198
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,185
The little one won't go anywhere.

199
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:43,485
Hand me your weapon.

200
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:47,405
If you touch him, he'll bleed.
You know that, right?

201
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,805
Or should I come with you peacefully?

202
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,205
Why are they in handcuffs?
- Do you regret it?

203
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,905
It's not by the rules.

204
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:41,005
You'll keep them for half a day
until the lab technicians arrive.

205
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:44,005
And you think about
what Enver and Hashim will say

206
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:47,205
when someone whispers to them
that the idea was yours.

207
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:52,505
Don't they pay you enough?

208
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:02,805
Are you leaving again?

209
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:05,305
I have to go to Banja Luka.

210
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:08,305
I have a meeting with the director
of the clinical center.

When are you coming back?
- In two days.

00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:19,105
Can I come with you?
I've never been there.

213
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:23,105
What about your work?

214
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:25,305
I'll take leave.

215
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:30,305
I can't take you.

216
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:34,105
I have a lot of work,
I don't know these people...

217
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,505
I can't take you.

218
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:41,005
Let him not see the messed-up
police and the mafia, and...

219
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:43,605
You keep disappearing,
coming back beaten! I'm tired!

220
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,805
I can't live like this anymore!

221
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:49,605

222
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:53,005
I'm tired!

223
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,605
Calm down, Maria!
- No, let me go!

224
00:22:56,305 --> 00:23:01,105
Calm down!
Calm down, please!

225
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:03,745
No.

226
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:07,745
Calm down, it's necessary.

227
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:11,345
I have to go, for us,
for the company. Calm down, please!

229
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:48,945
This is Dr. Mitrovich.

230
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:57,345
She came to help society.

231

Be afraid.

232
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:09,945
Now the doctor will take a sample
for DNA analysis from you and your brothers.

233
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:13,545
There's no way you haven't left
some evidence.

234
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:17,345
And this...

235
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:23,445
Do you know him?
- Can you?

236
00:24:24,545 --> 00:24:27,045
Open your mouth.

237
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:38,345
I heard you want to get involved
in a legal business?

238
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,945
To develop our skiing potential
to a European level!

239
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:49,345
And your cases will be handled
by Adnan Braha. - Shake hands.

240
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:05,645
It's not easy for you.

241
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:10,045
Your daughter is a drug addict,
your sons growing up as criminals.

242
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:19,445
You resemble each other.

243
00:25:20,845 --> 00:25:23,245
You look a lot like your father.

244
00:25:24,145 --> 00:25:26,345
And he, like you...

245
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:28,945
Until Skender cut his throat.

246
00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:33,945
And others say I resemble him.

247
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:36,745
Except my father didn't believe
in blood revenge.

248
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:42,245
And you?

249
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:45,445

252
00:26:17,345 --> 00:26:20,145

- Seriously, you're freaking me out.

253
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,945
I'm traveling, and I need
your car for two days.

254
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:28,745
Why don't you go with your own car?
- I can't explain it right now.

255
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,145
I'll tell you later.

256
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:34,845
Brother, you'll have to explain
this and a million other things, you know?

257
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:37,845
When I come to you.
Does 15 minutes work?

258
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:40,845
Well, let's go.

259
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:53,545
Did you bring my coupon?
- I broke it. Give me a cloth.

260
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:06,445
What do you need my car for?
- I have to go to Bosnia.

261
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:12,845
I messed up big time.
No one should know.

262
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:16,545
Understand?
- Misha, I can't tell you anything.

263
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:19,745
It's for your own good, trust me.
- I'll explode soon.

264
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:22,745
and take your secret to the grave.

265
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:27,245
Let's say I killed a person.

266
00:27:29,745 --> 00:27:32,045
Even two.

267
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,745
Oh, I lied to you, brother.

268
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:44,745
Three.

269
00:27:54,145 --> 00:27:56,545
I'm kidding. I lied to you.

270
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:59,945
Please don't tell me anything
until you're sure I'll explode.

271
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,545
I have to go, come on.
- Here's the key.

272
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:07,745
We'll see each other in two days.

273
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:10,145
Take care.

274
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:43,545
Damn it!

275
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:26,945

On what grounds is Mr. Berisha
and his associates detained?

279
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:46,545
Your clients are detained
because they are criminals.

280
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,845
They are suspected of committing
very serious murders.

281
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:52,145
And that within only
a few weeks.

282
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:54,945
Let's put speculation aside.

283
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:59,145
Do you know they can't
be interrogated without a lawyer?

284
00:30:59,445 --> 00:31:03,345
Absolutely. If we had interrogated them,
you would have been present.

285
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:06,145
We just took DNA samples from them.

286
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:09,145
So, can they go?
- Of course.

287
00:31:09,645 --> 00:31:12,845
Tomorrow morning. When the legal
24-hour deadline expires.

Do you have a few minutes?
- For what?

290
00:31:55,945 --> 00:31:59,045
Can we have a drink somewhere?
I need...

291
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:02,245
I need a bit of your time,
I want to show you something.

292
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:05,945
Look, I've been on my feet all day
and really have no strength for any talks.

293
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:11,045
Maria...
It's about Uros.

294
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,345
What should I do?
- Well, nothing.

295
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:04,845
Nothing?
- Nothing.

296
00:33:05,845 --> 00:33:08,545
Maybe you got used
to doing it like this?

297
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:15,525
Or otherwise.
- How?

298
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:18,525
Like this or otherwise.

299
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:20,925
Doesn't matter?
- Doesn't matter.

300
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:27,425
Does it bother you?
- Not for me.

301
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,525
But for you?
- For me, yes.

302
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,825
For you, yes, but not for me.
- And not for you.

303
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:36,035
Not for me. And for you?
- And for you, yes?

304
00:33:36,235 --> 00:33:38,535
For me, yes. And for you, no.

305
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:21,735
Won't you undress me too?

306
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:56,635
I'm listening.

307
00:34:56,835 --> 00:34:59,335
Do you know where
your husband is right now?

308
00:34:59,685 --> 00:35:02,425
Excuse me, but I don't understand.
Why do you care about that?

309
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:05,125
You don't want to answer
my question?

310
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:10,225
What does it matter to you
whether he called me or not?

311
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:22,025
Your husband parked his car
in the "Delta City" parking lot,

312
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:25,525
went inside, and hasn't come out.
His car is still there.

313
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:28,325
My question is,
do you know where he is?

314
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:31,125
He went on a business trip.

315
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:33,325
Without the car?

316
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:36,625
He probably took one of the company
vans, I don't know.

317
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:39,505
Has he called you?

318
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:43,785
I can't understand
what this interrogation is about?

319
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:46,455
What do you care
whether he called me or not?

320
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:49,215
He might have a lover.
He might have 7 lovers,

321
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:52,765
in 7 different countries! Is that a problem?

322
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:56,225
Is that a much smaller problem
than the one you have right now?

323
00:35:56,475 --> 00:35:59,485
And here we are talking about
the safety of you and your family.

324
00:36:07,385 --> 00:36:09,855
Thank you for the coffee.

325
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:12,655
Maria, I'm not your enemy.

326
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:16,255
Goodbye.

327
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:52,155
Hello?
- Hello, it's me.

328
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:55,725
Hey, what's this number?
Bosnian.

329
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:59,625
I forgot my phone in the office

330
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:02,425
and had to buy a new phone
and a new SIM card.

331
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,325
Where are you now?

332
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,725
Well... on my way to Banja Luka.

333
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:13,725
Are you using the bus?
No, I'm driving our car.

334
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,725
Why do you ask?

335
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:19,225
Well... nothing. Just asking.

336
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:25,325
Maria, is everything okay?

337
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:32,225
Is Viden awake?
He's sleeping, and she's with a friend.

338
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:36,525
Listen, I'll text you when I arrive.

339
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,625
I love you.
Okay, bye.

340
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,025
Come over.
I can't.

341
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:51,495
I don't want to go home.
Okay then.

342
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,495
No, you'll come home now.

343
00:38:55,195 --> 00:38:57,195
Let me smoke.

344
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:02,345
Will you call me tomorrow?

345
00:39:05,195 --> 00:39:07,445
Are you really not going to call me?

346
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,845
You're lying!
There's no reason for me to call you.

347
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:12,145
You're lying!
I'm kidding.

348
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:14,745
Go to sleep, what's wrong with you?

349
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:18,425
Come in.

350
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,625
Bye.

351
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:42,025
Do you know what time it is?

352
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:45,350
I was at Natasha's. Good night.

353
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,950
Natasha called your home phone,
your mobile was off.

354
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,150
Where were you?

355
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,550
I was walking in the park.

356
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,050
You're punished not to go out
for a week.

357
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,550
Good night.

358
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,450
Fine. Good night.

359
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,150
Come in.

360
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,425
Do you want something to drink?

361
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,865
If you treat me.

362
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:26,465
I have some wine.

363
00:41:27,325 --> 00:41:29,325
Dry, red.

364
00:41:47,425 --> 00:41:49,725
Where were you?

365
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:52,225
With friends.

366
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:55,725
And? What were you doing?

367
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,725
Nothing, we were watching football.
Football?

368
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,215
Really?

369
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,215
What's wrong with you?
What did we say about the little one?

370
00:42:08,015 --> 00:42:10,215
What are you doing with her?
Nothing.

371
00:42:10,415 --> 00:42:12,615
Huh? What are you doing, damn it?
Nothing.

372
00:42:12,815 --> 00:42:15,015
Damn it?
I'm not!

373
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:18,645
If I see you with her again
I'll kill her!

374
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,935
Drishlo!

375
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:15,435
Damn it.

376
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:48,145
